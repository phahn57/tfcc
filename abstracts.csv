Does arthroscopic assistance improve reduction in distal articular radius fracture? A retrospective comparative study using a blind CT assessment.,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to compare the articular reduction in two groups of patients with a distal articular radius fracture who underwent surgery with versus without arthroscopic assistance. The initial hypothesis of this study is that arthroscopic assistance does not improve reduction in distal articular radius fractures.METHODS: The study was retrospective (1/04/2014-01/04/2017) and included 41 patients: 23 had arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis, and 18 had not. All patients included had CT before and 3 months after surgery. All radiographic and CT measurements were retrospectively taken by an independent radiologist who did not know which operative technique was performed. Secondary judgement criteria were clinical analysis at 1-year follow-up and tourniquet time. We also reported all soft tissue injuries diagnosed and repaired and postoperative complications.RESULTS: At the third month, articular step was 0.91 ± 1.25 mm (arthroscopy) and 1.41 ± 1.68 mm (no arthroscopy), without statistical difference (p = 0.3756). No difference was found for articular gap between the two groups [arthroscopy (0.55 ± 1.04 mm), (no arthroscopy (0.82 ± 1.54 mm)] (p = 0.8574). Except for the tourniquet time, clinical results at 1-year follow-up were not different. One patient of each group had a scapholunate pinning, and 6 patients of the arthroscopy group had a TFCC 1B injury, which was repaired.CONCLUSION: This study did not demonstrate that arthroscopic assistance improves step and gap reduction of articular distal radius fracture, confirming initial hypothesis and recent literature data.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective, III.",European journal of orthopaedic surgery &amp; traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,30488139,2018
TFCC Lesions in Children and Adolescents: Open Treatment.,"BACKGROUND: There has been little discussion regarding the lesion of the TFCC in pediatric and adolescent patients. This study examines 11 cases treated with open technique.METHODS: Range of motion (ROM), strength and functional scores (QUICK DASH, PWRE, VAS pain, and NAKAMURA score) were evaluated.RESULTS: The mean postoperative flexion-extension arc was 95% of the contralateral side, the radio-ulnar deviation 91% of the contralateral side and the pronation-supination arc 94% of the unaffected side. Grip strength was 85.6% of the uninjured wrist, pinch was 88%. The mean PRWE decreased from 84.4 to 9.85 postoperatively. The mean Q-DASH scored 10.4. The VAS pain under stress decreased from a mean of 6.8 to a mean of 2.27, while at rest it decreased from a mean of 5 to a mean of 0.5. The final clinical results obtained by Nakamura score were 2 excellent, 6 good and 3 fair.CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes that open surgical TFCC repair is a safe and reliable therapeutic procedure in children and adolescent populations.",The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,30428785,2018
What is the Natural History of the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tear Without Distal Radioulnar Joint Instability?,"BACKGROUND: The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear is a common cause of ulnar-side wrist pain; however, its natural course is not well understood.PURPOSES: We sought (1) to determine the natural course of TFCC tears without distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability, and (2) to identify the factors associated with poor prognosis after nonsurgical treatment of TFCC tears.METHODS: Over a 3-year period, we treated 117 patients with TFCC tears who did not have DRUJ instability. The diagnosis was made on the basis of ulnar-sided wrist pain, a positive ulnocarpal stress test or ulnar grinding test, and identification of a tear on MRI or CT arthrography. Of those, 25 were excluded during the initial evaluation period because they met the previously defined indications of surgery on the basis of clinical history. Another 19 patients (20%) were lost to followup before 6 months, and one patient was excluded because of prior wrist surgery, leaving 72 wrists in 72 patients for analysis in this retrospective study, which drew data from a review of electronic medical records of one institution. The group consisted of 42 men and 30 women, with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18-70 years). The study group was followed for a mean of 16 months (range, 6 to 36 months). We evaluated the pain VAS and patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) at the initial visit, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and at more than 6 months after the initial visit. A PRWE score ≤ 20 points indicated complete recovery, and a PRWE score more than 20 points was considered an incomplete recovery. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression modelling to estimate the time to complete recovery and to identify factors associated with incomplete recovery among the seven possible factors of older age (≥ 45 years), male, obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m), dominant-hand involvement, chronic symptoms (≥ 6 months), traumatic tear, and ulnar-plus variance.RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that estimated cumulative incidence of complete recovery was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20-40) at 6 months and 50% (95% CI, 39-61) at 1 year. We could not find any risk factors among the seven candidate factors, including older age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.608; 95% CI, 0.34-1.087; p = 0.093), male (HR, 1.152; 95% CI, 0.667-1.991; p = 0.612), obesity (HR, 1.433; 95% CI, 0.603-3.402; p = 0.415), dominant hand involvement (HR, 1.808; 95% CI, 0.927-3.527; p = 0.082), chronic symptoms (HR, 0.763; 95% CI, 0.443-1.922; p = 0.133), traumatic tear (HR, 0.756; 95% CI, 0.432-1.32; p = 0.325), and ulnar plus variance (HR, 0.804; 95% CI, 0.461-1.404; p = 0.443).CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that nonsurgical treatment is moderately successful for treating patients with TFCC tears without DRUJ instability. We recommend a minimum of 6 months nonsurgical treatment as the first-line treatment for this injury. Future studies are necessary to clarify predictors of persistent pain with nonsurgical treatment to avoid an unnecessary surgical delay.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, prognostic study.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,30376460,2018
Effect of Total Flavones from Cuscuta Chinensis on Anti-Abortion via the MAPK Signaling Pathway.,"For centuries, the Chinese herb Cuscuta chinensis has been applied clinically for abortion prevention in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Total flavones extracted from Cuscuta chinensis (TFCC) are one of the active components in the herb and also display anti-abortion effect similar to the unprocessed material. However, how TFCC exerts the anti-abortion effect remains largely unknown. In this study, we aim at characterizing the anti-abortion effects of TFCC and its underlying molecular mechanism in vitro and in vivo using human primary decidua cells and a mifepristone-induced abortion model in rat, respectively. The damage to the decidua caused by mifepristone in vivo was reversed by TFCC treatment in a dosage-dependent manner. High dosage of TFCC significantly upregulated the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and prolactin receptor (PRLR) in decidua tissue but downregulated the expression of p-ERK. Furthermore, we detected higher level of p-ERK and p-p38 in primary decidua cells from spontaneous abortion while treatment by TFCC downregulated their expression. Our results suggest TFCC mediates its anti-abortion effect by interfering with MAPK signaling pathway.",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,30369955,2018
Volar dislocation of the ulnar head after distal radial fracture: Case report and review of the pertinent literature.,"We report the case of volar dislocation of the ulnar head occurred after osteosynthesis for the treatment of distal radius fracture.</AbstractText>: We report the case of volar dislocation of the ulnar head occurred after osteosynthesis for the treatment of distal radius fracture.The patient, 68-year-old female, had the dorsal displaced left distal radius fracture and volar dislocation of the ulnar head. Osteosynthesis was performed using a volar locking plate without postoperative immobilization. Two weeks after surgery, volar dislocation of the ulnar head in distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) was noted on CT. Re-operation, triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was sutured to the ulnar fovea using a suture anchor, was performed in order to stabilize DRUJ. At 24 months after surgery, left wrist joint pain and the range of motion have improved, and the Mayo wrist score was excellent.</AbstractText>: The patient, 68-year-old female, had the dorsal displaced left distal radius fracture and volar dislocation of the ulnar head.

Tenodesis of the Ulnotriquetrum Ligament to the Fovea for a Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tear.,"We developed a novel procedure to treat a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) foveal tear, namely tenodesis of the ulnotriquetrum ligament (UTL) to the fovea. We attempted to reestablish the tension of the palmar radioulnar ligament by the procedure specifically in cases with palmar radius instability relative to the ulna. We used a palmar surgical approach to expose the palmar aspect of TFCC in which the ulnocarpal ligament merges with the palmar radioulnar ligament. UTL was distally excised at a 4 mm width from the triquetrum without disrupting its ligamentous connection to the palmar radioulnar ligament proximally. We pulled out the distal UTL through the bone tunnel from the fovea to ulnar neck. The UTL graft was fixed to the fovea with an interference screw. In 13 cases, this procedure effectively decreased ulnar wrist pain, improved distal radioulnar joint instability, and restored wrist motion and grip strength.",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,30300245,2018
Prognostic Factors of Arthroscopic Debridement for Central Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tears in Adults Younger Than 45 Years: A Retrospective Case Series Analysis.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze factors that affect the treatment outcomes of arthroscopic debridement for central triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions in adults &lt;45 years of age.METHODS: A total of 71 patients (mean age, 39 years; range, 20-44 years) who had been arthroscopically diagnosed with central TFCC tears were treated with arthroscopic debridement. Demographic, clinical, and arthroscopic findings were examined and analyzed. The response to treatment, including pain numeric rating scale on an ulnar provocation test; Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score; and satisfaction with treatment, was assessed at 12-month follow-up.RESULTS: The mean pain numeric rating scale (6.6 ± 3.6 to 2.4 ± 2.0, P &lt; .01) and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (59.3 ± 15.0 to 33.7 ± 14.1, P &lt; .01) scores exhibited significant clinical improvement at 12-month follow-up. In terms of satisfaction, 43 patients (70.5%) were satisfied (enthusiastic or satisfied) and 18 (29.5%) were dissatisfied (noncommittal or disappointed). In the satisfied group, there were 24 flap and 19 wearing tears, whereas in the dissatisfied group, there were 4 flap and 14 wearing tears (P = .02). The extent of ulnar plus variance on preoperative radiographs also differed between the 2 groups (0.5 ± 1.2 vs 1.7 ± 1.1, P &lt; .01). There were no significant differences in age, gender, hand dominance, or work level between the groups. After controlling for confounding variables, the wearing type tears (odds ratio, 3.4) and greater ulnar plus variance (odds ratio, 2.0) were associated with a higher likelihood of dissatisfaction after arthroscopic TFCC debridement.CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical outcome scores showed significant improvement after arthroscopic debridement for central TFCC tears, wearing type tears and greater ulnar plus variance were associated with dissatisfaction and poorer postoperative outcomes after the procedure.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, case series.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,30292592,2018
Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Repair and Ulna Variance: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: This purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review of available literature regarding the association between ulnar variance and outcomes after repair of peripheral traumatic tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).METHODS: A systematic literature search of the medical literature about peripheral tears of the TFCC was performed. We selected seven studies comparing clinical outcome and ulnar variance in patients with peripheral TFCC tears. We evaluated quality of the articles using both the Structured Effectiveness Quality Evaluation Scale (SEQES) and Sackett's Level of Evidence (LOE). The outcomes were objective or self-assessment scoring systems for the function of the hand, wrist, or upper extremity.RESULTS: Seven articles were evaluated. The SEQES scores varied from 19 to 28, with a mean of 23. Five studies reported no association between ulnar variance and clinical outcome, and 2 studies reported an association. The studies reporting no association either excluded or did not mention the cases of unstable distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ).CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review did not demonstrate strong evidence regarding the association between ulnar variance and outcomes after TFCC repair. As most of the studies did not distinguish between capsular and foveal tears which can affect DRUJ stability, further studies looking at this point are necessary to determine whether ulnar shortening osteotomy has an added value for better outcomes after TFCC repair.",The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,30282532,2018
The Prevalence of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Signal Abnormalities on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Relative to Clinical Suspicion of Pathology.,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) signal changes in patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the wrist and its relationship to a clinical suspicion of TFCC pathology. The secondary purpose was to study factors that are associated with TFCC signal changes.METHODS: In this retrospective study, we looked for any TFCC signal changes in the reports of MRI findings performed during a 3-year period in 1,134 patients. Demographic characteristics, the categorized indications for MRI, and symptoms at the time of the MRI were also retrieved from the medical records. Patients were divided into 6 groups, based on age, to calculate the proportions of TFCC signal changes in the entire cohort and as an incidental finding among patients without a clinical suspicion of TFCC pathology within each age group.RESULTS: A total of 321 patients (28%) had incidental TFCC signal changes. The prevalence among 18- to 30 year-olds was 19%, and increased to 64% in patients older than 70 years. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that an increase in age is significantly associated with having TFCC signal changes on MRI in patients who have a low clinical suspicion of TFCC pathology. The rate of incidental TFCC signal changes steadily increases with age.CONCLUSIONS: The TFCC signal abnormalities on MRI are more common with increasing age in patients with low clinical suspicion of TFCC pathology. At age 70, more than half of all patients will have TFCC signal changes, and more than 90% are present in patients with a low clinical suspicion of TFCC pathology.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,30172277,2018
Outcomes of Operative Treatment of Triangular Fibrocartilage Tears in Pediatric and Adolescent Athletes.,"BACKGROUND: Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears have been treated with increasing frequency in pediatric and adolescent patients over the past decade. There is little information on these injuries in young athletes and a scarcity of data regarding their ability to return to preinjury levels of athletic participation. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes of pediatric and adolescent athletes with operatively treated TFCC tears with or without a concurrent ulnar shortening osteotomy and to determine their ability to return to their preoperative level of activity.METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients who underwent operative treatment of TFCC tears between 2006 and 2012 within one Upper Extremity practice. Patients were included if they were high-level athletes, unable to participate in their sport secondary to wrist pain and desired to return to their sport. All operative patients had imaging studies and clinical findings consistent with TFCC injury as the primary source of their activity-limiting pain and had failed nonoperative management prior to surgery. Patients without at least 3 months of documented postoperative follow up were excluded.RESULTS: In total, 22 patients were included in the chart review with 20 patients willing to participate in a telephone survey and PODCI. Eighty percent of patients returned to their sport following operative treatment of their injury at an average of 4.8 months. Seven of the 22 patients underwent a concurrent ulnar shortening osteotomy for ulnar positive variance. All 20 patients reported satisfaction with the outcomes of their surgery and treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Operative treatment of TFCC injuries in adolescent and pediatric athletes after failure of conservative treatment allowed return to sport at the previous level of participation. Concurrent ulnar shortening osteotomy in the setting of ulnar positive variance did not prohibit return to high-level athletic participation.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.",Journal of pediatric orthopedics,30134350,2018
Patients With Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Injuries and Distal Radioulnar Joint Instability Gain Improved Forearm Peak Pronation and Supination Torque After Reinsertion.,"BACKGROUND: Forearm peak pronation and supination torque measurements are reduced up to 30% in patients with triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) 1B injuries with concomitant distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether patients with TFCC 1B injuries, with concomitant DRUJ instability, improve in forearm peak pronation and supination torque following TFCC reinsertion surgery where postoperative DRUJ stability was achieved.METHODS: We report a retrospective case series with short-term follow-up (20 months) of the postoperative forearm peak torque in pronation and supination in 11 patients (9 women/2 men, average age at surgery 32 years) operated on by TFCC reinsertion. Two of the initial 13 patients were later on reoperated due to recurring DRUJ instability and were therefore excluded in this follow-up study. Nine were treated by arthroscopic TFCC reinsertion and 2 by open technique. The forearm peak pronation and supination torque were measured pre- and postoperatively and compared with the uninjured side.RESULTS: On average, a 16% improvement of the forearm peak torque was achieved in the injured wrist, as well as clinically assessed DRUJ stability. Functional postoperative improvement was noted in all patients, with reduced pain, good satisfaction, and acceptance of the surgery and the final result.CONCLUSION: We conclude that patients with TFCC injuries and DRUJ instability gain improved forearm peak pronation and supination torque after reinsertion. We also conclude that forearm peak pronation and supination torque is a valuable tool in the preoperative diagnostics of TFCC injuries with DRUJ instability as well as in the postoperative follow-up.","Hand (New York, N.Y.)",30081654,2018
Early and late fixation of ulnar styloid base fractures yields different outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: The role of surgical fixation of ulnar styloid fractures remains a subject of debate. The purpose of this study was to compare the surgical outcomes following early and late intervention.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 28 patients who underwent surgical repair for unilateral ulnar styloid fractures with distal radioulnar instability between 2004 and 2014. Surgical fixation was performed within 3 months of injury in 13 patients (group A) and beyond 3 months in 15 patients (group B). Patient characteristics and functional outcomes were compared between the two groups. The outcome survey consisted of QuickDASH score, grip strength, range of motion, pain score based on the visual analog scale, and surgical complications. Descriptive statistics were calculated for key variables. A p value of &lt; 0.01 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: Patient characteristics including age, sex, injured side, dominant side injury, and concomitant distal radius fracture showed no significant differences between the two groups. Time to surgery averaged 1.1 months in group A and 12.3 months in group B. Significantly better outcomes were found in group A than in group B, including QuickDASH scores (4.4 ± 5.9 vs. 12.9 ± 9.9) and grip strength (37.4 ± 5.1 vs. 29.1 ± 5.9 kg). Significantly better range of motion was found in group A than in group B with respect to supination (81.9° ± 4.3° vs. 75° ± 8.5°), extension (84.6 ± 4.3 vs. 76.7 ± 6.5), and flexion (80.4° ± 3.8° vs. 72° ± 4.1°). The difference was not significant in case of pronation (78.8° ± 3° vs. 74.3° ± 5.9°) and with respect to pain scores (0.6 ± 0.7 vs. 1.3 ± 1).CONCLUSION: Both osseous and soft tissue lesions need to be fully addressed in ulnar styloid fractures. Early detection and surgical repair yielded better outcomes. Higher complication rates in late-treated fractures show that surgeons should select surgical candidates and modalities properly.",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,30064441,2018
A novel staged wrist sensorimotor rehabilitation program for a patient with triangular fibrocartilage complex injury: A case report.,"STUDY DESIGN: Case report.INTRODUCTION: Studies have highlighted the sensory innervations and stabilizing role of forearm muscles on wrist joint and implications to wrist sensorimotor rehabilitation. This case explored the novel incorporation of dart-throwing motion and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation in wrist sensorimotor rehabilitation.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To describe and evaluate a staged wrist sensorimotor rehabilitation program for a patient with triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury.METHODS: The patient participated in the staged program for 9 sessions over a 3-month period. Treatment involved neuromuscular strengthening at the wrist and movement normalization of the upper extremity. Outcome measures were grip strength, visual analog scale, joint position sense, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, and patient-rated wrist evaluation.RESULTS: The patient showed improvement in all outcome measures. Most outcomes exceeded the established minimal clinically important difference values.DISCUSSION: The results suggest that dart-throwing motion and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation are beneficial in rehabilitation of TFCC injury.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that incorporated dart-throwing motion and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation in the sensorimotor rehabilitation of TFCC injury and yielded promising results. There is a need to further evaluate the program in prospective randomized controlled trial recruiting a larger group of patients with TFCC injury.",Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,30017412,2018
Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon and distal radioulnar joint in triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"BACKGROUND: We compared the incidence of extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) abnormalities using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between patients with triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears and subjects without ulnar wrist pain. Additionally, we aimed to identify potential predictors of these MRI lesions.METHODS: The TFCC group comprised 70 consecutive patients with TFCC tears. The control group comprised 70 age- and sex-matched subjects without ulnar wrist pain. We evaluated the presence or absence of fluid collection in the DRUJ and ECU peritendinous area and longitudinal ECU tendon splitting. Dimensions of the fluid collection area around the ECU tendon were measured to evaluate the severity. The incidences of these abnormal MRI findings were compared between the two groups. We analyzed the correlation between the presence of ECU tendon and DRUJ lesions and variables including age, magnitude of ulnar variance, and type of TFCC tear.RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the two groups in the incidence of fluid collection of the DRUJ and ECU peritendinous area, and longitudinal ECU tendon splitting. Among the 70 patients with TFCC tears, age and the magnitude of ulnar variance were significantly correlated with the severity of fluid collection around the ECU tendon. The magnitude of ulnar variance in patients with DRUJ fluid collection was significantly larger than that in patients without fluid collection. There was a significant correlation between the presence of disc tears and DRUJ fluid collection.CONCLUSION: We found a higher incidence of accompanying abnormal MRI findings of the ECU tendon and DRUJ in patients with TFCC tears than in the control group. The presence of disc tears, the magnitude of ulnar variance, and age may be risk factors for these MRI lesions associated with TFCC tears.",Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association,29983214,2018
Prognostic factors for the outcome of arthroscopic capsular repair of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"BACKGROUND: Little information is available about prognostic factors of arthroscopic capsular repair for peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions. The purpose of this study was to analyze factors that affect the treatment outcomes of arthroscopic capsular repair for peripheral TFCC tears.METHODS: This study retrospectively enrolled 60 patients who were treated with arthroscopic outside-in capsular repair for peripheral TFCC tears. Functional survey, including pain numeric rating scale (NRS) on an ulnar provocation test, distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ) stress test, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, and satisfaction with treatment, was conducted at 12-month follow-up. Patients who were enthusiastic or satisfied comprised the satisfied group, and those who were noncommittal or disappointed the dissatisfied group. Demographic, clinical, and arthroscopic findings were compared between the satisfied and dissatisfied groups.RESULTS: The mean pain NRS and DASH scores exhibited significant clinical improvement at the 12-month follow-up. Out of the total participants, 46 were satisfied and 14 were dissatisfied about the treatment, with significantly more female subjects in the dissatisfied group than in the satisfied one. The patients in the satisfied group had a shorter duration of symptoms, were more likely to have trauma history, and exhibited positive DRUJ stress test results compared to the dissatisfied group. There were no significant group differences in age, hand dominance, work level, and the extent of ulnar plus variance. Multivariable analysis revealed that female gender, a longer duration of symptoms, or negative DRUJ stress test results were associated with an increased disability after arthroscopic TFCC repair.CONCLUSION: Female gender, a longer duration of symptom, and a negative DRUJ stress test are associated with a higher likelihood of treatment failure after arthroscopic outside-in capsular repair of peripheral TFCC tears.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,29974215,2018
[Suture techniques for TFCC].,"Traumatic ruptures of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) may cause ulnar-sided wrist pain. These ruptures frequently lead to instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) because the ulnoradial ligaments, which are interwoven with the TFCC, are avulsed from the fovea of the ulnar head or-very rarely-from the radius. Conservative treatment may be sufficient, and some instability may be tolerated over time. In the case of persistent pain, operative repair by reattachment of the TFCC and, thereby, the ligaments to the previously debrided bone in the fovea is effective in reestablishing a stable, pain free DRUJ. Several arthroscopic and open repair techniques have been described in the last years. Contraindications such as the ulna-plus-situation or instability due to even minor degrees of malunion after fractures of the forearm bones must be kept in mind.An overview is given of the pathological anatomy, diagnosis, indications and suturing techniques.",Der Orthopade,29955933,2018
[Radiology of the distal radioulnar joint and the ulnocarpal complex].,"X-ray images exposed in neutral position and radiocarpally centred are essential in imaging of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). The anatomic orientation of the DRUJ is favourable for acquiring transaxial scans to display its anatomy, subtle derangements, osteoarthritis and intra-articular fractures free from superpositions. The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is the most important stabilizer of the DRUJ. Provided that a focused clinical indication is given, high-resolution images are acquired, and an intra-venous or intra-articular contrast-agent is applied, all TFCC structures and destabilizing lesions can be displayed with the use of CT and MRI.",Der Orthopade,29915995,2018
Prevalence and clinical characteristics of radiographic central triangular fibrocartilage complex tears in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals younger than 50 years.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed the prevalence of central triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears or their risk factors for symptom development. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of radiographic central TFCC tears in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and evaluate clinical characteristics of symptomatic individuals.METHODS: In this retrospective case control study, 221 patients younger than 50 years who exhibited positive ulnocarpal provocation test and underwent MRI to identify abnormalities associated with TFCC were age- and sex-matched with 221 controls who had undergone hand or wrist MRI for tumorous lesions or pain in hand other than ulnar-sided wrist. Demographic and radiologic parameters including the degree of ulnar plus variance, the type of central TFCC lesions, the presence of ulna head or carpal bone enhancement, and cartilage degeneration of ulno-carpal or distal radio-ulnar joint were compared. Multivariable regression analysis was carried out to identify independent risk factors for symptom development in patients with central TFCC lesions.RESULTS: The prevalence of central TFCC lesions was 68/221 in symptomatic patients, which was not significantly different from that (51/221) in asymptomatic controls. Patients in the symptomatic group had significantly greater ulnar plus variance (1.6 vs. 0.7). They were more likely to have type 1A tears and bony enhancement in ulnar head or carpus on MR images. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that youth, female gender, and presence of bony enhancement were significant risk factors for symptom development in central TFCC lesions.CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, prevalence of central TFCC lesions detected on MRI in symptomatic patients seems to be similar to that in asymptomatic individuals. Younger age, female gender, and presence of bony enhancement on MR images seem to be risk factors for symptoms of central TFCC lesions.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,29855684,2018
Treatment of distal radioulnar joint dislocation with spontaneous rupture of extensor tendon by Sauve-Kapandji osteotomy assisted by wrist arthroscopy: A case series and literature review.,"RATIONALE: Dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint and injury to distal forearm are commonly encountered. However, delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis has been relatively rare due to improved diagnosis and treatment. Treatment of old dislocation of radioulnar joint is challenging due to development of secondary chronic instability and difficulties in restoration of joint function.PATIENT CONCERNS: This report describes three cases of patients complained about inability to extend their little fingers.DIAGNOSES: Local examination and X-ray revealed chronic ulnar joint dislocation.INTERVENTION: Wrist arthroplasty was used to perform ulnar distal articular cleansing and repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) articular cartilage. The Sauve-Kapandji osteotomy was performed to treat radial joint dislocation and stabilize ulnar joint. Repair of spontaneous fracture of the extensor tendon was also performed. Postoperative gypsum was used for immobilization for 4 weeks.OUTCOMES: The follow-up results are reported. Based on Cooney wrist score, the preoperative scores were poor (55, 50, 60), while the post-operative scores were excellent (90, 85, 90) in all 3 cases.LESSONS: Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment is important for the recovery of distal radius fracture for patients with dislocation of the ulnar joint. The correct treatment determines the degree of later functional recovery. Early surgical treatment is recommended for patients with unsatisfactory reset. Delayed diagnosis and treatment often lead to chronic and persistent lower ulnar joint subluxation or dislocation, or even osteoarthritis. All patients in this report showed great improvement in wrist function after surgery.",Medicine,29851780,2018
[Arthroscopy of the distal radioulnar joint].,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the procedure is to visualize the proximal pouch of the DRUJ, the joint surfaces of the sigmoid notch and the ulnar head, the convexity of the ulnar head and the proximal ulnar side surface of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).INDICATIONS: Arthroscopy of the distal radioulnar joint is applied for the evaluation of joint pathologies in ulnar-sided wrist pain, especially in cases without diagnostic findings in standard X‑rays and MRIs and arthroscopically assisted procedures.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: In vertical extension, two portals of the wrist are created on the dorsal side of the DRUJ between the extensor digiti minimi and extensor carpi ulnaris tendons. By insertion of a small joint arthroscope via these portals visualization of the ulnar head, the sigmoid notch, the proximal pouch of the DRUJ and the proximal surface of the TFCC is accomplished.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopy of the DRUJ is a rarely and not routinely performed procedure for the diagnosis and therapy of ulnar-sided wrist pain. It is technical demanding with a flat learning curve and anatomy-related obstacles. A complete view of the joint is not always accessible. Rare complications are injuries of the extensor digiti minimi tendon, as well as contusion or sectioning of the transverse branch of the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. In distinct cases, this procedure offers important additional information about the distal radioulnar joint. The procedure is especially valuable for the detection of proximal TFCC injuries that are missed otherwise.",Der Orthopade,29797018,2018
MR arthrography is slightly more accurate than conventional MRI in detecting TFCC lesions of the wrist.,"INTRODUCTION: In case of clinical suspicion of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury, different imaging techniques are used. The aim of this study was to determine whether MRA is superior to MRI and whether 3.0 T is better than 1.5 T (expresses in sensitivity, specificity and accuracy) in detecting TFCC injury, using arthroscopy as the gold standard.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The arthroscopic and MR findings of 150 patients who underwent arthroscopy for ulnar-sided wrist pain between January 2009 and November 2016 were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: MRA was slightly more accurate compared to conventional MRI, and 1.5 T was slightly more accurate than 3.0 T. 1.5 T wrist MRA had a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 100% and accuracy of 90%; 3.0 T wrist MRA 73, 100 and 86%, resp. Conventional 1.5 T wrist MRI had a sensitivity of 71%, a specificity of 75% and accuracy of 73%. For 3.0 T conventional MRI, this was 73, 67 and 70%, resp.CONCLUSIONS: MRA seems slightly superior to conventional MRI, but one could question whether this difference in diagnostic accuracy outweighs the burden and risks of an invasive procedure for patients with its additional costs. Furthermore, we could not confirm the superiority of 3 T compared to 1.5 T.",European journal of orthopaedic surgery &amp; traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,29700613,2018
An Evaluation of the Reliability of Wrist Arthroscopy in the Assessment of Tears of the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex.,"PURPOSE: Wrist arthroscopy is generally considered the reference standard in the diagnosis of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries. There is a paucity of data examining the reliability of wrist arthroscopy as a diagnostic modality for TFCC injuries. The goal of this study was to evaluate the interobserver and intraobserver reliability of the diagnosis of TFCC pathology during wrist arthroscopy.METHODS: Twenty-five intraoperative digital videos were captured by the senior author during diagnostic and surgical arthroscopy of the wrist joint for known or suspected articular pathology. The senior author (P.K.B.) confirmed TFCC resilience on visual inspection and ballottement (trampoline effect) to make the diagnosis. Two videos were excluded for poor quality and inadequate visualization. Three hand surgeons subsequently reviewed the remaining 23 videos in a blinded fashion at 2 time points separated by 4 weeks. The reviewers determined if the trampoline test was positive and if a TFCC tear was present. Tears were classified using a morphologic classification. Statistical measures of reliability including percentage agreement and κ coefficients were calculated.RESULTS: Agreement between observers for the presence or absence of a tear was 66.7%. The average intraobserver agreement regarding the presence or absence of a tear was 67.4% The kappa value for interobserver agreement was 0.33, whereas the intrarater agreement was 0.88. The 3 reviewers identified an average of 11.3 positive trampoline tests. Agreement between observers for a positive trampoline test was 65.2%. The average percentage of intraobserver agreement regarding a positive trampoline test was 49.3%. In cases where all 3 reviewers agreed on the presence of a TFCC tear, the agreement regarding tear location was 76.6%.CONCLUSIONS: Wrist arthroscopy remains instrumental in the treatment of TFCC tears. However, given that inter-rater reliability in the assessment of these tears is probably too low, reconsideration should be given to arthroscopy as the reference standard in the diagnosis of these tears.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic III.",The Journal of hand surgery,29602654,2018
Chronic Essex-Lopresti injury: a systematic review of current treatment options.,"INTRODUCTION: Essex-Lopresti lesion (ELL) is a severe injury. Most of ELL is recognized in chronic phase representing a therapeutic challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. The aim of this systematic review is to highlight and criticize current concepts in the surgical treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. A comprehensive research of Pubmed database was made using the following Mesh term: ((Essex-Lopresti injury) OR (Essex Lopresti) OR (distal radio ulnar dissociation) OR (distal radio ulnar dislocation) OR (longitudinal forearm instability)). Quality assessment of each article was performed according to Coleman score by two authors.RESULTS: Eight full articles were included to the systematic review. Surgical treatment was differentiated in five categories according to the most common procedure reported in clinical series. The mean Coleman Score was 51.13 ± 9.76.DISCUSSION: Case series reported in the literature include a limited number of patients with chronic ELL. Currently, salvage procedure devoted to treat a wrong diagnosis and an incorrect treatment is used. Radial head replacement together with ulnar shortening osteotomy and interosseous membrane reconstruction are the most common treatments of choice, but at present, there is not yet a shared scheme of management for patients with chronic ELL.CONCLUSIONS: According to current literature, a case-by-case treatment must always be considered. Further investigations, with higher level of evidence, quality of study design, and number of patients, are needed to better assess clinical results and complication of each technique.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",International orthopaedics,29572641,2018
Open versus arthroscopic repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the outcome of open versus arthroscopic repair of injuries of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).METHODS: An electronic literature search of articles published between January 1, 1985, and May 26, 2016, in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was carried out in May 2016 and updated in March and December 2017. Studies comparing open and arthroscopic repair of TFCC injury with a mean follow up of more than 1 year were eligible for inclusion. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist guided the extraction and reporting of data. The methodological quality of the included articles was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. The primary outcome measure was the rate of postoperative distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) re-instability. Secondary outcome measures were range of motion (ROM), grip strength, residual pain, functional wrist scores and the rates of complications and re-operations.RESULTS: A total of 868 articles were identified by the electronic search. After duplicate removal and subsequent study selection, a total of two studies were included in this systematic review. The methodological quality of the included articles displayed risks of bias. There was no difference in DRUJ re-instability between open and arthroscopic repair of the TFCC. There were no differences in obtained postoperative ROM, grip strength or values in functional outcome scores, between open and arthroscopic TFCC repair in the two included studies, except for the Disability of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire - in favor of arthroscopic surgery - in one of the included studies.CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows comparable results between open and arthroscopic repair of the TFCC, in terms of DRUJ re-instability and functional outcome scores. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one technique over the other in clinical practice. There is an immense lack of comparison studies with high level of evidence in the area of wrist ligament repair and reconstruction, including TFCC-injuries and DRUJ-instability.",Journal of experimental orthopaedics,29536282,2018

[Diagnosis and treatment of degenerative disc lesions of the wrist].,"BACKGROUND: The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) widens the radiocarpal joint and takes part in load transmission from the carpus to the forearm. It is thereby prone to degenerative changes. The painful situation that can accompany degeneration is called ulnar impaction.DIAGNOSIS: Clinical examination helps differentiate between various causes of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Standard X‑rays are needed to determine ulnar variance and stress radiographs can depict narrowing of the ulnocarpal joint space under load. MRI may prove degeneration of the TFCC itself or may indirectly confirm ulnar impaction in the presence of bone marrow edema in the ulnar head or at the proximal ulnar aspect of the lunate.TREATMENT: If conservative treatment fails to alleviate symptoms, arthroscopy may be indicated. On the one hand, this completes the diagnostic cascade, and, on the other hand, allows decompression of the ulnocarpal joint space by resection of the TFCC with partial resection of the ulnar head (wafer resection). In the case of ongoing pain, ulnar shortening sufficiently alleviates ulnar-sided wrist pain. Thereby, modern standardized operation techniques are safe enough to ensure bone healing at the osteotomy site. The aim of alleviating ulnar-sided wrist pain is mostly achieved if the correct treatment option is chosen.",Der Orthopade,29523902,2018
The Effect of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tear on Wrist Proprioception.,"PURPOSE: This study examined the influence of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) deep fiber tears on wrist proprioception.METHODS: The study involved 48 subjects: 24 with deep fiber TFCC tears and 24 with healthy wrists. A specially created sensor measured wrist proprioception in 3 axes of movement. Absolute differences between target and subject-reproduced angles were compared in injured and healthy wrists and in injured and contralateral patient wrists. A greater difference in reproduced angles was deemed to reflect a lesser ability to approximate a target angle.RESULTS: In wrists with TFCC injuries, 40° pronation and 60° pronation showed significantly greater differences between target and subject-reproduced angles compared with those in the control wrists. In wrists with TFCC injuries, 40° pronation demonstrated significantly greater differences between target and subject-reproduced angles than did those in patients' contralateral wrists. Proportions of outliers with absolute differences greater than 6° were significantly higher in 60° supination and 40° pronation in wrists with TFCC injuries.CONCLUSIONS: Deep TFCC fiber detachment may lead to decreased wrist proprioception in 60° and 40° forearm rotation.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Deep TFCC fiber tear may contribute to decreased wrist rotational positioning sense and may have biomechanical importance in distal radioulnar joint stability.",The Journal of hand surgery,29523373,2018
Results after arthroscopic treatment of central traumatic lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"INTRODUCTION: Injuries of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are of high clinical relevance; however, the clinical evidence for treatment is poor and long-term results are rarely published. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of symptomatic central traumatic lesions of the TFCC (Palmer 1A) following arthroscopic debridement.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2013, 87 patients were arthroscopically diagnosed with Palmer 1A lesion and accordingly treated with debridement. Follow-up was available for 43 patients. Activities of daily living (ADLs) were measured with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Pain perception was evaluated with visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10). Grip strength and wrist motion were assessed with conventional techniques using a Jamar dynamometer and a goniometer. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a questionnaire at follow-up.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 42.5 months (range 5-70). The mean age of the patients (22 male and 21 female) at time of surgery was 41 ± 15.9 years. No major complication occurred during surgery and follow-up. The DASH score (preoperatively 49.8 ± 19.3 vs. postoperatively 14.1 ± 17.9, p &lt; 0.05) and pain perception (VAS: preoperatively 7.2 ± 2.0 vs. postoperatively 1.4 ± 1.6, p &lt; 0.05) improved significantly. Grip strength was satisfactory after surgery (19.6 ± 13.1). Ulnar deviation improved significantly from 29.3 ± 10.4° to 35.6 ± 8.3° (p &lt; 0.05) and wrist flexion improved from 53.8 ± 18.9° to 67.4 ± 12.9° (p &lt; 0.05). Wrist extension, radial deviation, pronation and supination did not change significantly after surgery. Improved symptoms were reported by 41/43 (95.3%) patients and 40/43 (93%) patients would have had the same procedure again knowing the final outcome. Six of 43 patients (15%) had an ulnar plus variance. None of these needed ulnar shortening.CONCLUSIONS: Central traumatic TFCC lesions can safely be treated by arthroscopic debridement. We showed a sustained pain relief with significantly improved quality of life (DASH score) and wrist motion at follow-up. This resulted in a high patient satisfaction and acceptance of the procedure.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, level IV.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,29508106,2018
Protective effects of total flavonoids from Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Ktze on myocardial injury in vivo and in vitro via regulation of Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Ktze is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, which comprises the plant's total flavonoids. TFCC plays an important role in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to study the protective effects and possible mechanism of TFCC against isoproterenol (ISO)-mediated myocardial injury in vivo and anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R)-induced H9c2 cell injury in vitro.METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were intragastrically pretreated with TFCC for 15 days. After 2 h of TFCC administration on days 14 and 15, a myocardial injury model was established with intragastric administration of 120 mg/kg of ISO daily for 2 days. The experiment was stopped 12 h after the last administration of the drugs. ECG recordings were taken after the treatment. Serum samples were assayed to determine the serum cardiac enzymes (e.g., creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase). The left ventricle was excised for histopathological examination, and myocardial homogenates were prepared to detection catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), heme oxygenase-1(HO-1),and peroxidase were detected by the corresponding ELISA kits. H9c2 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of TFCC for 12 h before A/R exposure. Afterward, cell viability, LDH release, hoechst 33,342, and peromide iodine (PI) double staining, JC-1 staining, and ROS examination were determined. Western blot analyses of B-cell lymphoma-2, Bcl-2associated X protein, cleaved cysteinylaspartate specific protease-3 and-9, nuclear factor 2(Nrf2), HO-1 and serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT), and P-AKT were conducted.RESULTS: The pretreatment of TFCC (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) daily for 15 days prevented ISO-induced myocardial damage, including the decrease in serum cardiac enzymes and cardiomyocyte apoptotic index and improvement in the heart rate and vacuolation. TFCC also improved the free radical scavenging and antioxidant potential, thereby suggesting that one possible mechanism of TFCC-induced cardio protection is mediated by blocking the oxidative stress. To clarify these mechanisms, we performed the in vitro study by A/R-induced cytotoxicity model in H9c2 cells. TFCC pretreatment prevented apoptosis, increased the expression of HO-1, and enhanced the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. TFCC also activated phosphorylation of AKT, whereas the addition of LY294002, which is the pharmacologic inhibitor of PI3K, blocked the TFCC-induced Nrf2/HO-1 activation and cytoprotective effect.CONCLUSIONS: TFCC protects against myocardial injury and enhances cellular antioxidant defense capacity by inducing the phosphorylation of AKT, which subsequently activated the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,29496179,2018
The status of triangular fibrocartilage complex after the union of distal radius fractures with internal plate fixation.,"PURPOSE: Distal radius fractures are associated with a high incidence of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears. This study aims to evaluate the status of TFCC after the healing of distal radius fractures, and its clinical significance.METHODS: Wrist arthroscopies were performed on 43 distal radius fractures, with an average age of 54 years old.RESULTS: Twenty-six complete tears and 15 partial healed tears were noted. Five out of eight patients with intact TFCC tears had neither signs nor symptoms, while eight patients with TFCC tears had no complaint. While no association was found between ulnar wrist pain and TFCC tears, there was association between DRUJ instability and TFCC tears and fovea tears. The function outcome did not differ with respect to the integrity of TFCC.CONCLUSIONS: A large majority of TFCC tears remained unhealed after the union of distal radius fractures. However, not all patients with tear were symptomatic.",International orthopaedics,29476211,2018
Editorial Commentary: Wrist Ulnar Impaction Syndrome: When I Use the Wafer Procedure and When I Do Not.,"Ulnar impaction syndrome is fundamentally a clinical diagnosis, which can be confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. All palmer stages are amenable to surgical treatment with either arthroscopic wafer procedure (AWP) or ulnar shortening osteotomy, and neither the absence of a triangular fibrocartilage complex perforation nor neutral or negative variance contraindicate either. Because of its minimally invasive value proposition and likely success, there are few clinical scenarios for which I do not perform AWP preferentially. Furthermore, AWP is always preferable in smokers and in wrists in which a divergent orientation of the sigmoid notch and ulnar articular surfaces portend arthritic complication after ulnar shortening.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,29413189,2018
Arthroscopic Diagnosis of the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Foveal Tear: A Cadaver Assessment.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether the arthroscopic hook and trampoline tests are accurate and reliable diagnostic tests for foveal triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) detachment.METHODS: Wrist arthroscopy was performed on 10 cadaveric upper extremities. Arthroscopic hook and trampoline tests were performed and videos recorded (baseline). The deep foveal TFCC insertion was then sharply detached. Arthroscopic hook and trampoline tests were repeated. Subsequently, the foveal detachment was repaired via an ulnar tunnel technique and the hook test was repeated for a third time. Videos were independently reviewed at 2 time points by 2 fellowship-trained hand surgeons and 1 hand surgery fellow in a randomized and blinded fashion. Hook and trampoline tests were graded as positive or negative. Proportions of categorical variables were compared via 2-tailed Fisher exact test. Inter- and intraobserver reliabilities were assessed via Cohen kappa coefficient.RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the hook test for foveal detachment diagnosis were 90% and 90%, respectively. There was 90% agreement among all 3 observers for the baseline and foveal detachment hook tests. Cohen kappa coefficients for the inter- and intraobserver reliabilities of the hook test were 0.87 and 0.81, respectively. Seventeen percent of trampoline tests were positive at baseline versus 43% after foveal detachment. The trampoline test had 45% agreement between the 3 observers. Cohen kappa coefficients for the inter- and intraobserver reliabilities of the trampoline test were 0.16 and 0.63, respectively. Following ulnar tunnel repair, 20% of hook tests were positive.CONCLUSIONS: The hook test is highly sensitive, specific, and reliable for the diagnosis of isolated TFCC foveal detachment. The trampoline test has insufficient reliability to assess foveal detachment. A TFCC foveal repair using an ulnar tunnel technique returns the hook test to baseline.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The hook test is a sensitive, specific, and reliable test for the diagnosis of isolated TFCC foveal detachment.",The Journal of hand surgery,29395584,2018
Arthroscopic Treatment of Type 1B Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tear by &quot;Outside-In&quot; Repair Technique Using Transcapsular Transverse Mattress Suture.,"Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries are increasingly recognized as a cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Palmer grouped these tears into either traumatic or degenerative, with various subclassifications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), arthrogram, and arthroscopy are the methods used to establish the diagnosis. Several arthroscopic methods of TFCC repair including outside-in, inside-out, and all-inside techniques have been described. The outside-in repair, which involves piercing the TFCC via the ulnar side of the wrist, has been described by several authors, but the technique varies among authors with respect to instrumentation and subtle surgical modifications. The purpose of this article was to present the technique of arthroscopic outside-in repair using transverse mattress suture for type 1B TFCC tear by modifying classic vertical mattress sutures into sutures that pass completely through the disc.",Arthroscopy techniques,29354477,2018
Biomechanical Analysis of Capsular Repair Versus Arthrex TFCC Ulnar Tunnel Repair for Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tears.,"BACKGROUND: This study compares the effectiveness of a peripheral capsular repair with a knotless arthroscopic transosseous ulnar tunnel repair (TR) in restoring distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) stability and stiffness in the setting of a massive triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear.METHODS: Eight matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric forearms were tested. Each forearm was tested in supination and pronation using 3-dimensional (3D) optical tracking devices prior to any intervention. Each specimen then underwent a diagnostic wrist arthroscopy and sectioning of the TFCC's deep and superficial fibers. All specimens were then retested to assess instability secondary to the tear. The TFCC was repaired with either a peripheral capsular repair (CR) using three 2-0 polydioxanone sutures or a transosseous ulnar TR using a 2-0 FiberWire, and then retested (statistical significance; P &lt; .05).RESULTS: After TFCC arthroscopic sectioning, all specimens were unstable with a significant increase in translation and a significant decrease in stiffness. TFCC repair with TR resulted in displacement and stiffness similar to the native tissue. CR specimens were found to have significantly greater displacement and significantly decreased stiffness compared with the intact state.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic sectioning of the TFCC resulted in DRUJ instability, as measured by stiffness and ulnar translation. TR effectively restored DRUJ stability and demonstrated no significant difference in postoperative stiffness or maximal displacement when compared with the intact specimen in pronation and supination. This study provides biomechanical evidence that an arthroscopic ulnar tunnel technique can restore stability to the DRUJ after a massive TFCC tear.","Hand (New York, N.Y.)",29322875,2018
Point-of-care wrist ultrasonography in trauma patients with ulnar-sided pain and instability.,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of point-of-care wrist ultrasonography compared with 3T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries in trauma patients with ulnar-sided pain and instability. Moreover, we assessed the inter-observer variability between an emergency physician and a musculoskeletal radiology fellow.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in an emergency department; patients with ulnar-sided sprain and instability were recruited. An emergency physician and a musculoskeletal radiology fellow independently evaluated the TFC, meniscal homologue, volar and dorsal distal radioulnar ligaments, and extensor carpi ulnaris using point-of-care ultrasonography. Findings were classified as normal, partial rupture, or complete rupture. Wrist 3T-MRI was used as the reference standard. We compared the diagnostic values for point-of-care ultrasonography obtained by both reviewers using DeLong's test. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for agreement between each reviewer and the reference standard, and directly between the two reviewers.RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were enrolled. Point-of-care wrist ultrasonography showed acceptable sensitivity (97.2-99.1%), specificity (96.8-97.3%), and accuracy (96.9-97.9%); these diagnostic performance values did not differ significantly between reviewers (p=0.58-0.98). Agreement between each reviewer and the reference standard was excellent (emergency physician, ICC=0.964; musculoskeletal radiology fellow, ICC=0.976), as was the inter-observer agreement (ICC=0.968).CONCLUSION: Point-of-care wrist ultrasonography is as precise as MRI for detecting TFCC injuries, and can be used for immediate diagnosis and further preoperative imaging. Moreover, it may shorten the interval from emergency department admission to surgical intervention while reducing costs.",The American journal of emergency medicine,29307765,2018
20-Year outcome of TFCC repairs.,"The aims of this study were to investigate the functional result and rate of osteoarthritis 15-25 years after a TFCC-repair. Forty-seven patients completed the questionnaire Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), and 43 had new X-rays. Fifty-seven percent had a simultaneous arthroscopy. Sixteen patients had later additional surgery to the wrist, of these eight had a reoperation of the TFCC-injury due to recurrent instability. Radiographs showed that 17.5% had developed radiocarpal osteoarthritis and 34% osteoarthritis in the distal radioulnar joint. The median PRWE result was 22.5. Patients with radiocarpal osteoarthritis and patients who had additional surgery had significantly worse scores. Patients who had undergone arthroscopy significantly less often had developed radiocarpal osteoarthritis. The result is acceptable but not impressive and efforts should be made to diagnose these injuries early and also diagnose associated injuries, advisably by arthroscopy.",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,29258363,2017
Arthroscopic one-tunnel transosseous foveal repair for triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) peripheral tear.,"PURPOSE: Arthroscopic repair of a peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear is a promising, minimally invasive surgical technique, especially in patients with symptomatic distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical result of arthroscopic one-tunnel transosseous foveal repair for peripheral TFCC tears.METHODS: Sixteen patients who underwent TFCC foveal repair were retrospectively evaluated. The mean follow-up period was 31.1 months. The torn TFCC of all patients was repaired with the arthroscopic one-tunnel transosseous foveal repair technique. Postoperative outcomes were evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, wrist range of motion, grip strength, Mayo wrist score, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (Quick DASH) score, and postoperative complications.RESULTS: On arthroscopic examination, all 16 patients showed Palmer 1B type peripheral TFCC tears with foveal disruption. Among them, 13 patients had a proximal component TFCC tear (Atzei class 3) and 3 patients had a complete TFCC tear (Atzei class 2). At the final follow-up, the mean range of the pronation-supination arc (P = 0.03) and grip strength (P = 0.001) was significantly increased. Twelve patients had normal stability of the DRUJ and six patients showed mild laxity compared with the contralateral side. The mean VAS for pain perception decreased from 3.7 to 0.8 (P = 0.001). The modified Mayo wrist (P = 0.001) and Quick DASH (P = 0.001) scores showed significant functional improvement. No surgery-related complications occurred.CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that arthroscopic one-tunnel transosseous repair is a good treatment strategy for TFCC foveal tears in terms of reliable pain relief, functional improvement, and re-establishment of DRUJ stability.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,29124362,2017
Acute and a 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study of total flavonoids from Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Ktze in mice and rats.,"Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Ktze (Labiatae), known as 'Duanxueliu' in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, has been widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of hemorrhagic disease. Total flavonoids from Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Ktze (TFCC), the most active ingredient, possess a variety of properties, such as antioxygenation. Until now, evidence-based toxicity data on TFCC has been limited. This study evaluated the acute (in mice and rat) and the 28-day repeated-dose (in rat) toxicity study of TFCC, respectively. In acute study, oral administration of TFCC to rats and mice did not induce toxicity or mortality up to the maximum doses of 4000 and 5000 mg/kg, respectively. In subacute toxicity study, we administered TFCC at daily doses of 70, 210, and 630 mg/kg for 4 consecutive weeks to rats via gavage. We observed no changes in food consumption, water intake, body weight, chemistry and hematological parameters, organ weight, gross pathology or histopathology. No animals from any group died. These findings indicate that TFCC is relatively nontoxic, and provide practical guidance for selecting a safe dose for further investigation of TFCC in animal studies or clinical trials.",Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,29107008,2017
MRI findings in bucket-handle tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is an intricate ligamentous and cartilaginous structure that helps transmit axial load across the wrist, and provide stability to the ulnocarpal and distal radioulnar joints (DRUJ). Because the blood supply to the TFCC varies depending on location, certain types of tears are more amenable to surgical repair than others. Since Palmer proposed his classification system of TFCC tears in 1989, only 1 case of a &quot;bucket-handle&quot; type tear has been reported. In this article, we describe two new cases of bucket-handle tears of the TFCC. In both cases, the torn fragment was displaced into a previously undescribed location (intra-articular DRUJ and prestyloid recess). Because this type of injury pattern has not been previously well characterized in the literature and such cases rarely reported, MRI findings have not been fully described and its implications on clinical management have largely yet to be determined.",Skeletal radiology,29075810,2017
A Systematic Review of Outcomes after Arthroscopic Débridement for Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tear.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the effectiveness of arthroscopic débridement for a triangular fibrocartilage complex tear is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of outcomes to evaluate the effectiveness of débridement for triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.METHODS: The authors searched all available literature in the PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE (Ovid) databases for articles reporting on triangular fibrocartilage complex tear débridement. Data collection included arc of motion, grip strength, patient-reported outcomes, and complications.RESULTS: A total of 1723 unique studies were identified, of which 18 studies met the authors' criteria. The mean before and after arc of wrist extension/flexion motion values were 120 and 146 degrees (six studies). The mean before and after grip strength values were 65 percent and 91 percent of the contralateral side (10 studies). Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores (six studies) and pain visual analogue scale scores (seven studies) improved from 39 to 18, and from 7 to 3, respectively. The mean pain visual analogue scale score after débridement was 1.9 in the ulnar-positive group and 2.4 in the ulnar-neutral and ulnar-negative groups. Eighty-seven percent of patients returned to their original work.CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported reduced pain and improved functional and patient-reported outcomes after débridement of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.

Although some of these cases may require secondary procedures, simple débridement can be performed with suitable satisfactory outcomes for cases with any type of ulnar variance.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,29068932,2017
Outcomes of surgically treated distal radial fractures with associated triangular fibrocartilage complex injury.,"STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort.INTRODUCTION: Clinical studies that evaluate the correlation between associated lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and outcome of distal radial fractures expressed with the patient-rated disability are missing.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the outcomes of distal radius fractures associated with or without an injury of the TFCC.METHODS: Patients undergoing operative treatment for distal radial fracture were prospectively enrolled (n = 70). The TFCC was examined by wrist arthroscopy, and injuries were classified according to Palmer. Comparative analyses were performed on data from 45 patients with TFCC injury (the injured group) and 25 patients with an intact TFCC (the intact group). The outcome measures included The Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, 3 and 12 months after injury.RESULTS: The TFCC was injured in 45 patients (64%). In patients with an intact TFCC, the mean total PRWE score was 27 (at 3 months) and 16 (at 12 months), whereas in patients with TFCC injury, it was 40 (at 3 months) and 24 (at 12 months). Mean DASH scores were 26 and 13 for the intact group and 39 and 27 for the injured group at 3 and 12 months, respectively. PRWE and DASH results showed significant difference at 3 and 12 months when compared using the Mann-Whitney test.CONCLUSIONS: Disability outcomes were worse in patients with distal radial fracture where TFCC was injured. TFCC injuries are an important cofactor affecting the outcome of distal radial fractures.",Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,29054543,2017
Arthroscopic Evaluation of Associated Soft Tissue Injuries in Distal Radius Fractures.,"The best outcome in distal radius fractures is achieved if anatomy is restored, in particular the intra-articular congruity. This is achieved partly with improved fixation, such as using volar locking plates, and partly by using an arthroscopy-assisted reduction and fixation technique. In addition to improving the intra-articular congruity, associated ligament and chondral injuries can be detected and treated. This article outlines various associated injuries with suggested management in a stepwise fashion. It is hoped that overall outcomes will be improved once patient-related and treatment-related factors have been evaluated and previously undetected associated ligament injuries have been found and treated.",Hand clinics,28991577,2017
Arthroscopic Management of Ulnocarpal Impaction Syndrome and Ulnar Styloid Impaction Syndrome.,"Both ulnocarpal impaction syndrome and ulnar styloid impaction syndrome can produce ulnar wrist pain. The definition and clinical differentiation are explained. The relevant anatomy, biomechanics, causes, diagnosis, and arthroscopic treatments, as well as the surgical indications, techniques, and outcomes of these syndromes are discussed in detail.",Hand clinics,28991576,2017
Arthroscopic-Assisted Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Reconstruction.,"Injury of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is a common cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Volar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments and their foveal insertion are the most important stabilizing components of the TFCC. In irreparable tears, anatomic reconstruction of the TFCC aims to restore normal biomechanics and stability of the distal radioulnar joint. We proposed a novel arthroscopic-assisted technique using a palmaris longus tendon graft. Arthroscopic-assisted TFCC reconstruction is a safe and effective approach with outcomes comparable to conventional open reconstruction and may result in a better range of motion from minimizing soft tissue dissection and subsequent scarring.",Hand clinics,28991575,2017
Arthroscopic Management of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Foveal Injury.,"The deep component of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) inserts onto the fovea of the ulnar head. This component is critical to provide distal radioulnar joint stability. The surgical techniques and results of transosseous inside-out TFCC foveal repair are discussed. The rewarding results encouraged the repair of TFCC to the fovea arthroscopically. Although the results are good, the factors of age (traumatic or degenerative) and quality of stump and TFCC proper, which relate to the results should be considered in the future.",Hand clinics,28991574,2017
Arthroscopic Management of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Peripheral Injury.,"Patients suffering from ulnar-sided wrist pain after trauma may develop tenderness, clicking, a positive fovea sign, or instability of the distal radioulnar joint. If the pain is persistent, conservative treatment does not help, and the patient agrees to surgery, arthroscopy may reveal a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury with capsular detachment, foveal avulsion, or a combination thereof. Capsular reattachment is possible using an arthroscopic assisted technique. The reattachment can be performed with an inside-out, outside-in, or all-inside technique, providing good to excellent results, which tend to persist over time, in 60% to 90% of cases.",Hand clinics,28991573,2017
Chronologic and Geographic Trends of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Repair.,"This article shows trends in triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) repair since 1990 by geographic area and year. The repair methods presented in the literature were inside-out, outside-in, all-inside, and open repair. The outside-in technique was reported most often for ulnar-side tears, whereas the inside-out technique was reported most frequently for radial-side tears. Recently, a foveal reattachment technique for ulnar-side tears has garnered attention and has been reported with increasing frequency, especially in Asia, because the deepest portion of TFCC, attached to fovea, plays a key role in stabilizing the distal radioulnar joint. Understanding these trends can help clinicians best treat TFCC tears.",Hand clinics,28991572,2017
MR imaging of the traumatic triangular fibrocartilaginous complex tear.,"Triangular fibrocartilage complex is a major stabilizer of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). However, triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear is difficult to be diagnosed on MRI for its intrinsic small and thin structure with complex anatomy. The purpose of this article is to review the anatomy of TFCC, state of art MRI imaging technique, normal appearance and features of tear on MRI according to the Palmar's classification. Atypical tear and limitations of MRI in diagnosis of TFCC tear are also discussed.",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,28932701,2017
Distal radioulnar joint instability.,"Distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability is a rare but disabling problem. Surgical treatment remains a challenge. The advent of arthroscopic techniques has helped to rebuild the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC), especially its deep part. However, isolated TFCC damage is not responsible for instability. Its repair is sometimes not sufficient to restore DRUJ stability, or the chronicity of the injury prevents its direct repair. Open surgical procedures still have a role in these cases. They require a detailed knowledge of the various stabilizers of the DRUJ. Passive and active stabilizers other than the TFCC include the bones, joint capsule, oblique distal bundle of the interosseous membrane and the extensor carpi ulnaris. The objective of this review was to analyze current anatomical and biomechanical data on DRUJ stability. Different arthroscopic and open repair techniques for these structures will be reviewed. Lastly, a decision tree will be presented that can be used to better plan the management of this complex entity, because most of these injuries often occur in combination in RUD instability cases.",Hand surgery &amp; rehabilitation,28865983,2017
Advanced Imaging Techniques of the Wrist.,"OBJECTIVE: This article covers the technical aspects and clinical applications of recent advancements in wrist MRI techniques, including T2 and T1rho mapping, compressed sensing, and isotropic 3D imaging using driven equilibrium sequences, variable-flip-angle refocusing pulse sequences, and parallel imaging. The clinical applications of these techniques include the quantitative analysis of cartilage and triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) degeneration, faster scanning times, and improved resolution of complex wrist anatomy, allowing differentiation of degenerative from traumatic TFCC tears and improved morphologic evaluation of chondromalacia.CONCLUSION: MRI of the wrist and of the musculoskeletal system has had multiple novel and exciting advancements in recent years. Several of these advancements, such as parallel imaging, are already in clinical use, and others will be entering the clinical realm in the near future. An understanding of these techniques allows one to use their advantages to greatest effect.",AJR. American journal of roentgenology,28829171,2017
High-resolution MRI (3T-MRI) in diagnosis of wrist pain: is diagnostic arthroscopy still necessary?,"INTRODUCTION: 3T MRI has become increasingly available for better imaging of interosseous ligaments, TFCC, and avascular necrosis compared with 1.5T MRI. This study assesses the sensitivity and specificity of 3T MRI compared with arthroscopy as the gold standard.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients were examined with 3T MRI using coronal T1-TSE; PD-FS; and coronal, sagittal, and axial contrast-enhanced T1-FFE-FS sequences. Two musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated the images independently. Patients underwent diagnostic arthroscopy.RESULTS: The classifications of the cartilage lesions showed good correlations with the arthroscopy findings (κ = 0.8-0.9). In contrast to the arthroscopy, cartilage of the distal carpal row was very good and could be evaluated in all patients on MRI. The sensitivity for the TFCC lesion was 83%, and the specificity was 42% (radiologist 1) and 63% (radiologist 2). For the ligament lesions, the sensitivity and specificity were 75 and 100%, respectively, with a high interobserver agreement (κ = 0.8-0.9).DISCUSSION: 3T MRI proved to be of good value in diagnosing cartilage lesions, especially in the distal carpal row, whereas wrist arthroscopy provided therapeutic options. When evaluating the surgical therapeutical options, 3T MRI is a good diagnostic tool for pre-operatively evaluating the cartilage of the distal carpal row.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,28808768,2017
High-resolution 3-T MRI of the triangular fibrocartilage complex in the wrist: injury pattern and MR features.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate if using high-resolution 3-T MRI can identify additional injuries of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) beyond the Palmer classification.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients with surgically proven TFCC injury were included in this study. All patients underwent high-resolution 3-T MRI of the injured wrist. The MR imaging features of TFCC were analyzed according to the Palmer classification.RESULTS: According to the Palmer classification, 69 patients could be classified as having Palmer injuries (52 had traumatic tears and 17 had degenerative tears). There were 17 patients whose injuries could not be classified according to the Palmer classification: 13 had volar or dorsal capsular TFC detachment and 4 had a horizontal tear of the articular disk.CONCLUSION: Using high-resolution 3-T MRI, we have not only found all the TFCC injuries described in the Palmer classification, additional injury types were found in this study, including horizontal tear of the TFC and capsular TFC detachment. We propose the modified Palmer classification and add the injury types that were not included in the original Palmer classification.",Skeletal radiology,28808764,2017
Radiological degenerative changes in the distal radioulnar joint after ulnar shortening osteotomy in patients with idiopathic ulnar impaction syndrome: Analysis of factors affecting degenerative lesions.,"PURPOSE: To identify factors influencing overall radiologic changes in the distal radioulnar joint after ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO) in patients with idiopathic ulnar impaction syndrome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 310 patients who had undergone USO between May 2007 and December 2013 were included in this retrospective case-control study. The patients were classified into two groups (with or without radiologic findings of new arthritic changes), after which the following factors were analyzed: 1) demographic factors; 2) radiologic aspects, including ulnar variance (UV), morphological DRUJ type (classified according to Tolat et al.), and union period after USO; and 3) operative aspects, including the triangular fibrocartilage complex degeneration type, use of a parallel double-blade saw, type of plate used for fixation, and plate position on the volar or dorsal ulnar surface.RESULTS: Group 1 (no arthritic changes) consisted of 243 patients, whereas Group 2 (arthritic changes) consisted of 67 patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the presence of lunate cystic changes, amount of shortening, and the union period were significantly associated with newly developed arthritic changes in the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) after USO. The morphological DRUJ type was not a significant factor. Arthritic changes were significantly more prevalent in patients with a shortening amount &gt;4.5 mm and a union period &lt;3.25 months.CONCLUSIONS: Radiologic arthritic changes after USO, were associated with the presence of cystic changes in the lunate, a shortening amount (&gt;4.5 mm), and early bony union (&lt;3.25 months).LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level III.",Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association,28709834,2017
Anatomic Reconstruction of Distal Radioulnar Ligaments With Tendon Graft for Treating Distal Radioulnar Joint Instability: Surgical Technique and Outcome.,"Among the various reasons for chronic posttraumatic ulnar-sided wrist pain, instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) has recently received major attention and finally achieved fundamental progress in understanding thanks to anatomic and biomechanical studies. This has resulted in more physiological and successful treatment methods compared with the historic options. One and the most dramatic surgical technique consists in the replacement of the main ligamentous stabilizer of the DRUJ, the so-called triangular fibrocartilage, with a tendon graft. On the basis of our experience, the refined surgical technique is presented as well as the results obtained in a retrospective consecutive case series of 48 patients with 48 wrists followed-up for 16 months in average (6 to 43) clinically and radiographically. Out of 48 unstable DRUJ's stability was restored in 44 patients associated with a significant pain relief by 1.44 points (on a scale 0 to 4). There was however a loss of forearm rotation of 20 degrees in average (pronation-8 degrees; supination-12 degrees), whereas the range of motion of the wrist and grip strength remained unchanged. We did not find any influence on the result by performing simultaneous ulnar shortening osteotomy, the duration of cast immobilization or the positioning in the cast. There were no postoperative complications, 4 failed cases needed secondary procedures (2× rereconstruction, 2× Sauvé-Kapandji-operation).",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,28708756,2017
Results of Arthroscopic Repair of Peripheral Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tear With Exploration of Dorsal Sensory Branch of Ulnar Nerve.,"BACKGROUND: Ulnar-sided approach in arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) repair may jeopardize treatment success by exposing the dorsal sensory branch of ulnar nerve (DSBUN) in risk of injury. We aim to conduct a follow-up assessment of arthroscopic outside-in TFCC repair and efficacy of sensory nerve exploration.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 58 patients (59 wrists) who received arthroscopic repair of the peripheral attachment of the TFCC. Ulnar-sided skin incision and exploration of DSBUN were performed before arthroscopy setting. Arthroscopic outside-in repair through pullout suture ligation was performed. Functional survey at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively was based on Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), and compared to the preoperative assessment. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant as calculated using paired t-test.RESULTS: Postoperative MMWS averaged 74.32±11.50 at 6 months, and 84.41±9.52 at one year; both showed significant difference as compared to preoperative status. Significant improvement was noted in all 4 individual items except motion retrieval between 6 months and 1 year. Totally, 45 (76%) cases achieved good or excellent results at one year; however, less patients resumed pre-injury activity level when treatment delay was more than 6 months than those treated earlier (41% vs. 57%). Complication included 6 transient paresthesia; 1 anchor migration and 1 distal radioulnar arthrosis. No more nerve complication was found after modification of perineural dissection.CONCLUSION: Arthroscopy is effective in obtaining both correct diagnosis and treatment of peripheral TFCC tear. Modified perineural dissection can minimize sensory nerve complications.",The open orthopaedics journal,28694892,2017

Wrist Arthroscopy in Children and Adolescent With Chronic Wrist Pain: Arthroscopic Findings Compared With MRI.,"BACKGROUND: Wrist arthroscopy is a dynamic diagnostic procedure and its indications are growing as a treatment modality in the adult population. The aim of the study was to retrospectively report our series of pediatric and adolescence with chronic wrist pain, with or without wrist instability who underwent wrist arthroscopy after failing at least 4 months of conservative management. Our secondary aim was to report the sensitivity and specificity of clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation for various injury subgroups against the gold standard of the arthroscopic findings. Technical challenges, complications, and outcomes are also discussed.METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of 32 pediatric and adolescent patients who underwent wrist arthroscopy was conducted. Preoperative clinical diagnosis, radiographic, and intraoperative findings including classifications of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and interosseous ligaments were obtained. Patients were followed up to 1 year postoperatively and were discharged if symptom free.RESULTS: Thirty-three wrist arthroscopies in 32 patients were performed from 1996 to 2004. There were 2 male and 30 female patients. At arthroscopy 16 wrists were found to have TFCC injuries, 11 wrists had scapholunate injuries, and 8 had lunotriquetral (LT) injuries. Clinical examination for diagnosis of TFCC injury was too sensitive and nonspecific; however, clinical diagnosis of scapholunate injury was sensitive and specific. LT injury was under diagnosed clinically. Magnetic resonance imaging was found to have a low sensitivity for diagnosis of LT injury but diagnosis of TFCC was sensitive and specific.CONCLUSIONS: The sex ratio of 2 males:30 females was startling. Nevertheless, this therapeutic level 3 study supports a thorough search for pathology in any patient with persistent wrist symptoms because pathology was identified in 32 of the 33 wrists at arthroscopy.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-Therapeutic.",Journal of pediatric orthopedics,28594695,2017
High-resolution 3 T MRI of traumatic and degenerative triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) abnormalities using Palmer and Outerbridge classifications.,"AIM: To investigate the usefulness of high-resolution 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the evaluation of traumatic and degenerative triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) abnormalities among three groups: patients presenting with wrist pain who were (a) younger than age 50 years or (b) age 50 or older (PT&lt;50 and PT≥50, respectively), and (c) asymptomatic controls who were younger than age 50 years (AC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-resolution 3 T MRI was evaluated retrospectively in 96 patients, including 47 PT&lt;50, 38 PT≥50, and 11 AC. Two board-certified radiologists reviewed the MRI images independently. MRI features of TFCC injury were analysed according to the Palmer classification, and cartilage degeneration around the TFCC was evaluated using the Outerbridge classification. Differences in MRI findings among these groups were detected using chi-square test. Cohen's kappa was calculated to assess interobserver and intra-observer reliability.RESULTS: The incidence of Palmer class 1A, 1C and 1D traumatic TFCC injury was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in PT≥50 than in PT&lt;50 (class 1A: 47.4% versus 27.7%, class 1C: 31.6% versus 12.8%, and class 1D: 21.1% versus 2.1%). Likewise, MRI findings of TFCC degeneration were observed more frequently in PT≥50 than in PT&lt;50 (p&lt;0.01). Outerbridge grade 2 or higher cartilage degeneration was significantly (p&lt;0.01) more frequently seen in PT≥50 than in PT&lt;50 (55.3% versus 17% in the lunate, 28.9% versus 4.3% in the triquetrum, 73.7% versus 12.8% in the ulna).CONCLUSION: High-resolution wrist MRI at 3 T enables detailed evaluation of TFCC traumatic injury and degenerative changes using the Palmer and Outerbridge classifications, with good or excellent interobserver and intra-observer reliability.",Clinical radiology,28522258,2017
Arthroscopic Assisted Resection of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Lesions: A 19-Year Follow-up.,"BACKGROUND: This study assesses long-term functional and subjective outcomes following arthroscopic assisted resection of lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).METHODS: Functional and subjective outcomes were assessed based on review of patient charts for patient demographic characteristics, comprehensive clinical evaluation, obtained radiographs, and patient-reported questionnaires.RESULTS: Fifteen patients, of whom 9 were female, and 10 dominant wrists, were included in this study. Median age was 60 (range, 37-73) years, and median duration of follow-up was 19 (range, 18-21) years. Median Mayo Wrist Score was 85 (range, 45-100). Four patients scored excellent, 7 good, 3 fair, and 1 poor result according to the Modified Mayo Wrist Score. Median Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Arm was 20 (range, 0-45) and Patient-Rated Wrist and Hand Evaluation was 8 (range, 0-61). Patients reported high rate for satisfaction and low rate for pain. All patients presented intact stability of the distal radioulnar joint.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates persisting satisfactory subjective and functional outcomes for patients following arthroscopic assisted resection for lesions of the TFCC at 19 years of follow-up. Arthroscopically assisted resection of selected TFCC lesions seems to be both a safe and efficient procedure.","Hand (New York, N.Y.)",28511611,2017

Prognostic Factors Affecting Union After Ulnar Shortening Osteotomy in Ulnar Impaction Syndrome: A Retrospective Case-Control Study.,"BACKGROUND: Ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO) is a widely adopted procedure with excellent outcomes. However, delayed union or nonunion has occasionally been observed. The purpose of this retrospective case-control study was to identify variables affecting osseous consolidation after USO in patients with ulnar impaction syndrome.METHODS: The study included 325 patients who had undergone USO between March 2008 and March 2014. We evaluated the association between union and basic demographic factors as well as preoperative pain (assessed on a visual analog scale [VAS]), range of wrist motion, grip strength, and modified Mayo wrist score. We also assessed the association of union with radiographic variables such as the degree of dorsal subluxation of the ulna, preoperative and postoperative ulnar variance, morphological type of the distal radioulnar joint, gap at the osteotomy site, and presence of newly developed arthritic changes during the follow-up period. Finally, variables associated with operative conditions, such as degeneration of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, use of a parallel double-blade saw, type of plate used for fixation, number of screws, and plate position on the volar or dorsal ulnar surface were investigated.RESULTS: Ulnar union was achieved in 294 patients (group 1), and 31 patients had delayed union or nonunion (group 2). On univariate and multivariate analyses, smoking, low bone mineral density (BMD), a decreased range of motion of the wrist, and use of a double-blade saw were found to be significant factors for an adverse radiographic outcome (nonunion or delayed union).CONCLUSIONS: Delayed union or nonunion occurred in about 10% of patients treated with USO. We suggest that it may be preferable to perform USO in nonsmokers, patients with normal bone density, and those without restricted wrist motion. Also, we recommend the use of a single-blade saw when performing the osteotomy.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

Arthroscopically Assisted Transosseous Foveal Repair of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex.,"The radioulnar ligament of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), especially the deep fibers inserted at the ulnar fovea, is the key component for the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) stability. Traumatic injuries to the TFCC foveal insertion would cause DRUJ instability. Traditionally, arthroscopic techniques of the TFCC repair are suturing the ulnar-sided disruption peripherally to the dorsal or ulnar capsule instead of suturing the TFCC to the fovea and thus fail to restore the DRUJ stability if the TFCC is detached from the fovea. Recently, some arthroscopic foveal repair techniques have been reported using a suture anchor or transosseous sutures to address the foveal tear. This technical note describes an arthroscopic transosseous technique to reattach the foveal-disrupted TFCC. A 1.6-mm small osseous tunnel is created on the radial border of the fovea and 4 sutures are passed into the tunnel by using a 16-gauge needle. The TFCC could be sutured arthroscopically with these 4 sutures and be compressed against the fovea. Our technique provides not only a good suture construct for TFCC foveal reattachment but also an anatomic contact surface between the torn TFCC and its foveal footprint for healing. We recommend this technique as an alternative for repairing TFCC foveal tear.",Arthroscopy techniques,28373941,2017
High-resolution 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex in Chinese Wrists: Correlation with Cross-sectional Anatomy.,"BACKGROUND: The injury of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is a common cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain. The aim of this study was to investigate if the high-resolution 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could demonstrate the detailed complex anatomy of TFCC in Chinese.METHODS: Fourteen Chinese cadaveric wrists (from four men and three women; age range at death from 30 to 60 years; mean age at 46 years) and forty healthy Chinese wrists (from 20 healthy volunteers, male/female: 10/10; age range from 21 to 53 years with a mean age of 32 years) in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital from March 2014 to March 2016 were included in this study. All cadavers and volunteers had magnetic resonance (MR) examination of the wrist with coronal T1-weighted and proton density-weighted imaging with fat suppression in three planes, respectively. MR arthrography (MRAr) was performed on one of the cadaveric wrists. Subsequently, all 14 cadaveric wrists were sliced into 2 mm thick slab with band saw (six in coronal plane, four in sagittal plane, and four in axial plane). The MRI features of normal TFCC were analyzed in these specimens and forty healthy wrists.RESULTS: Triangular fibrocartilage, the ulnar collateral ligament, and the meniscal homolog could be best observed on images in coronal plane. The palmar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments were best evaluated in transverse plane. The ulnotriquetral and ulnolunate ligaments were best visualized in sagittal plane. The latter two structures and the volar and dorsal capsules were better demonstrated on MRAr.CONCLUSION: High-resolution 3T MRI is capable to show the detailed complex anatomy of the TFCC and can provide valuable information for the clinical diagnosis in Chinese.",Chinese medical journal,28345546,2017
Diagnostic accuracy of musculoskeletal ultrasound and conventional radiography in the assessment of the wrist triangular fibrocartilage complex in patients with definite diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) and x-ray in evaluating wrist triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in patients with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPPD) and to investigate the agreement between the extent of the calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystal deposits assessed by MSUS and the radiographic findings.METHODS: We enrolled 84 patients: 36 patients with &quot;definite&quot; CPPD and 48 controls. The Ryan and McCarty diagnostic criteria were used. A rheumatologist performed bilateral MSUS examinations of the TFCC in all patients, assessing both the presence and absence of CCP crystals deposits and their extent (0-3; 0: absent; 1: 1-2 spots; 2: more than two spots covering &lt;50% of the volume of the structure; 3: deposits covering &gt;50% of the volume of the structure). A radiologist evaluated the presence/absence of x-ray calcifications at TFCC level in both groups.RESULTS: MSUS and x-ray sensitivity was 77.8% and 76.4%, respectively, whereas MSUS and x-ray specificity was 90.6% and 96.9%, respectively. Total agreement between MSUS and radiographic findings indicative of calcifications at TFCC level was 88.7%.CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the diagnostic accuracy of MSUS and x-ray in evaluating TFCC crystal deposits in patients with CPPD. Sensitivity and specificity of MSUS and x-ray resulted comparable. The highest MSUS score of the extent of the deposits correlated better with x-ray findings.",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,28339356,2017
Impact of Distal Ulnar Fracture Malunion on Distal Radioulnar Joint Instability: A Biomechanical Study of the Distal Interosseous Membrane Using a Cadaver Model.,"PURPOSE: Certain distal ulna fractures may contribute to distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability. We hypothesized that residual distal ulna translation could affect DRUJ stability by slackening the distal interosseous membrane (DIOM). We aimed to test this hypothesis in a cadaver model.METHODS: We created an ulnar translated distal ulna fracture model in 6 cadavers. Dorsal and palmar displacements of the ulna relative to the radius were measured and DRUJ instability was staged under the following conditions: (1) 0-, 2-, and 4-mm ulnar translation of the distal ulna with an intact triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and DIOM; (2) 0-, 2-, and 4-mm translations with TFCC divided and an intact DIOM; and (3) a 0-mm translation with TFCC and DIOM divided.RESULTS: With an intact TFCC, dorsal and palmar displacements were not increased with any amount of distal ulna translation. After TFCC division with 0-mm translation, dorsal displacement increased significantly with DRUJ dislocation, whereas palmar displacement increased to a lesser extent with DRUJ subluxation. Palmar displacement gradually increased as the translation increased, and with 4-mm translation the ulnar head displaced to a perched position off the sigmoid notch. With TFCC and DIOM division, displacements increased markedly with DRUJ dislocation both dorsally and palmarly.CONCLUSIONS: Dorsal dislocation occurred when the TFCC was divided regardless of the amount of distal ulna translation. Palmar subluxation occurred when the TFCC alone was divided. Palmar displacement to a perched position occurred because of slackening of the DIOM as a result of translation of the distal ulna. Bidirectional DRUJ instability with dorsal dislocation and palmar displacement to a perched position occurred when the TFCC was divided and the distal ulna was ulnarly translated.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Bidirectional DRUJ instability might occur when distal ulna translation deformity is associated with TFCC injury because the DIOM loses its function as a secondary stabilizer.",The Journal of hand surgery,28259283,2017
The Effect of Ligament Injuries on Outcomes of Operatively Treated Distal Radius Fractures.,"Various authors have documented wrist ligament injuries in patients with distal radius fractures (DRFs). We conducted a study to determine whether scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL), triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), or chondral injuries directly assessed with arthroscopy predict DRF outcomes. Forty-two patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of DRFs were enrolled in the study. At time of fracture surgery, patients were arthroscopically evaluated for SLIL and TFCC injuries and chondral surface damage. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire was the primary outcome measure at 1 year. Analysis of variance was performed to evaluate for correlations between ligamentous/chondral injuries and DRF outcomes. Forty-five percent of patients had SLIL injuries, 50% had TFCC injuries, and 29% had articular cartilage injuries. There were no significant differences in DASH scores among the different injury groups and no significant differences in terms of secondary outcomes. SLIL and TFCC injuries occur in more than 70% of patients with operatively treated DRFs. These injuries appear not to have major negative effects on DRF outcomes up to 1 year after surgery.","American journal of orthopedics (Belle Mead, N.J.)",28235122,2017
Clinical and functional outcome of open primary repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears associated with distal radius fractures.,"We evaluate the clinical and functional outcome of open primary repair of acute TFCC tears in distal radius fracture, when there is gross intraoperative distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability after fixation of the distal radius, in the absence of an ulnar styloid fracture or when the ulnar fracture fragment is too small to be fixed.</AbstractText>: We evaluate the clinical and functional outcome of open primary repair of acute TFCC tears in distal radius fracture, when there is gross intraoperative distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability after fixation of the distal radius, in the absence of an ulnar styloid fracture or when the ulnar fracture fragment is too small to be fixed.A retrospective review of our institution's distal radius fracture database over a 4-year period (January 2010 to December 2013).

Ulnar-sided wrist pain in the athlete (TFCC/DRUJ/ECU).,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this manuscript is to review key historic and recent literature regarding extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) injuries, particularly in athletes.RECENT FINDINGS: Many recent studies examining the ECU focus on clinical and radiographic diagnosis. Several physical exam findings are described in addition to the use of MRI and US. Imaging studies must be clinically correlated due to high incidence of findings in asymptomatic patients. In regard to the TFCC/DRUJ, there are numerous recent studies that support the use of MRA as an adjunctive diagnostic study. There are also a number of repair constructs that are described for the various different kinds of TFCC pathology reviewed here. In summary, there are a number of options for the diagnosis and treatment of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Patient factors, especially in the athletic population, must be taken into account when approaching any patient with these pathologies.",Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine,28185125,2017
Arthroscopic assisted tendon reconstruction for triangular fibrocartilage complex irreparable tears.,"We report our 11-year experience of performing arthroscopically assisted triangular fibrocartilage complex reconstruction in the treatment of chronic distal radio-ulnar joint instability resulting from irreparable triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries. Eleven patients were treated. Three skin incisions were made in order to create radial and ulna tunnels for passage of the tendon graft, which is used to reconstruct the dorsal and palmar radio-ulnar ligaments, under fluoroscopic and arthroscopic guidance. At a mean follow-up of 68 months all but one had a stable distal radio-ulnar joint. Pain and grip strength, Mayo wrist score, Disability of the Arm Hand and Shoulder and patient-rated wrist and hand evaluation scores improved. The ranges of forearm rotation remained largely unchanged. Complications included an early tendon graft tear, two late-onset graft ruptures, one ulna styloid fracture during surgery and persistent wrist discomfort during forearm rotation requiring tendon graft revision in one case. An arthroscopic assisted approach for triangular fibrocartilage complex reconstruction appears safe and produces comparable results with the open technique.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",28183230,2017
Classification of ulnar triangular fibrocartilage complex tears. A treatment algorithm for Palmer type IB tears.,"The classical definition of 'Palmer Type IB' triangular fibrocartilage complex tear, includes a spectrum of clinical conditions. This review highlights the clinical and arthroscopic criteria that enable us to categorize five classes on a treatment-oriented classification system of triangular fibrocartilage complex peripheral tears. Class 1 lesions represent isolated tears of the distal triangular fibrocartilage complex without distal radio-ulnar joint instability and are amenable to arthroscopic suture. Class 2 tears include rupture of both the distal triangular fibrocartilage complex and proximal attachments of the triangular fibrocartilage complex to the fovea. Class 3 tears constitute isolated ruptures of the proximal attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex to the fovea; they are not visible at radio-carpal arthroscopy. Both Class 2 and Class 3 tears are diagnosed with a positive hook test and are typically associated with distal radio-ulnar joint instability. If required, treatment is through reattachment of the distal radio-ulnar ligament insertions to the fovea. Class 4 lesions are irreparable tears due to the size of the defect or to poor tissue quality and, if required, treatment is through distal radio-ulnar ligament reconstruction with tendon graft. Class 5 tears are associated with distal radio-ulnar joint arthritis and can only be treated with salvage procedures. This subdivision of type IB triangular fibrocartilage complex tear provides more insights in the pathomechanics and treatment strategies.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",28132592,2017
Diagnosing central lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage as traumatic or degenerative: a review of clinical accuracy.,"This study examined the reliability of surgeons' estimations as to whether central lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex were traumatic or degenerative. A total of 50 consecutive central triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions were independently rated by ten experienced wrist surgeons viewing high-quality arthroscopy videos. The videos were reassessed after intervals of 3 months; at the second assessment surgeons were given the patient's history, radiographs and both, each in a randomized order. Finally, the surgeons assessed the histories and radiographs without the videos. Kappa statistics revealed fair interrater agreement when the histories were added to the videos. The other four modalities demonstrated moderate agreement, with lower Kappa values for the assessment without videos. Intra-rater reliability showed fair agreement for three surgeons, moderate agreement for two surgeons and substantial agreement for five surgeons. It appears that classification of central triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions depends on the information provided upon viewing the triangular fibrocartilage complex at arthroscopy.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",28080158,2017

Biomechanical Comparison of Open and Arthroscopic Transosseous Repair of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Foveal Tears: A Cadaveric Study.,"PURPOSE: To biomechanically compare the stability between open repair and arthroscopic transosseous repair technique for reattachment of the foveal triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). We also evaluated the feasibility of a new aiming device for the creation of 2 bone tunnels simultaneously during the arthroscopic technique.METHODS: Six matched pairs of fresh-frozen forearm cadaver specimens were prepared for testing. Group I specimens were treated by open repair with suture anchor. Group II specimens were treated by arthroscopic transosseous suture with a new aiming device. Before and after disruption of the TFCC fovea and after its repair, dorsal and palmar translation of the ulna was measured in both groups in response to a load (3 kg) applied in the palmar and then in the dorsal direction. The total translation of the ulna was calculated as the sum of the mean dorsal and palmar translations.RESULTS: The mean total ulnar translation before and after TFCC disruption, and after TFCC repair was 5.94 ± 2.16 mm, 9.08 ± 2.64 mm, and 6.04 ± 2.18 mm, respectively. The specimens demonstrated a significant increase in the total translation of the ulna after disruption of the ulnar attachment of TFCC (P = .003), whereas a significant decrease was observed after TFCC foveal repair (P = .003). The median percentage of eliminated translation after TFCC repair was 64% and 172%, respectively, in groups I and II (P = .043).CONCLUSIONS: The athroscopic transosseous suture technique demonstrated superior repair efficacy to the open repair technique in terms of biomechanical strength. This cadaveric study also demonstrated the feasibility of a new aiming device.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When making decisions about TFCC foveal repair, arthroscopic transosseous suture technique may provide better biomechanical strength than the open repair technique.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,28034486,2016
Medium- to long-term outcomes of anatomical reconstruction of the radioulnar ligament to the ulnar fovea.,"We examined the medium- to long-term outcome of the original reconstruction technique of the radioulnar ligament using a half-slip of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon for chronic foveal avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. We treated 37 wrists in 36 patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Of 36 patients, 12 had more than 10 years follow-up. At final follow-up, 30 patients (31 wrists) reported no pain, five patients (five wrists) reported mild occasional pain and one patient reported severe persistent pain. Two patients had lost 30° of supination. Complete stability of the distal radio-ulnar joint was achieved in 31 wrists, moderate instability was noted in five and severe distal radio-ulnar joint instability remained in one. The size of the bone tunnel was assessed radiologically: in two it had enlarged; in 23 it was unchanged; and in 12 it appeared to have closed over the tendon graft. The overall clinical outcomes were 28 excellent, four good, four fair and one poor. The 12 wrists with more than 10 years follow-up had seven excellent, three good and two fair clinical results. This reattachment technique appears to work and last over the medium- to long-term.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",27932401,2016
A long-term (20 years') follow-up after arthroscopically assisted repair of the TFCC.,"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to assess long-term functional outcome for patients after arthroscopic assisted suture for peripheral tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).METHODS: Eleven patients, 26 (15-59) years old at time of surgery, 48 (35-78) years old at time of follow-up, were available for this 20-year follow-up. Subjective and objective outcomes, such as range of motion, grip strength, patients' satisfaction, pain, and Mayo Modified Wrist Score, were assessed, as well as asking the question if the patients would have had the surgery done again, knowing the outcome, based on a clinical examination and patient reported questionnaires.RESULTS: Median Mayo Wrist score was 85 (30-100) and, according to the Modified Mayo Wrist Score, seven patients presented good or excellent results. The patients reported median low 25 (0-66) on pain and median high 90 (1-100) on satisfaction. Ten patients presented with intact stability of the distal radioulnar joint at follow-up. Compared to the level of pain prior to surgery, two patients reported to be free of pain, five patients experienced major pain relief, two patients reported minor pain relief, while two patients reported no difference.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study support the trend of persisting good results for the majority of patients having undergone arthroscopically assisted repair with an outside-in suture technique for peripheral tears of the TFCC.",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,27917687,2016
[Ligament injuries of the wrist].,"The distal radioulnar joint, the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and the wrist are stabilized by many ligaments allowing not only a wide range of motion but also providing sufficient stability. The complex arrangement of carpal ligaments and prosupination around the forearm joint enables multiaxial motion patterns. In the wrist, intra-articular ligaments can be differentiated from extra-articular capsular ligaments as well as intrinsic and extrinsic ligament courses. Imaging is essential for classification of dynamic and static instability patterns. This review article illustrates the ligamentous anatomy of the wrist, the symptoms of carpal instability as well as the diagnostic capability of projection radiography, cinematography, computed tomography (CT) arthrography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR arthrography.",Der Radiologe,27909756,2016
[Pathology of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex in distal radius fractures].,"Distal radius fracture is actually quite rarely isolated and triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) is often involved with the same mechanism of injury. A contemporary management of the treatment of the initial fracture is ideal and so benefits from a routine arthroscopic management. Nevertheless, in the absence of diagnosis and therefore early treatment, the symptoms may be located at the ulnar crossroads and justify specific treatment of TFCC. It is generally conducted after an accurate arthroscopic lesion classification guiding a procedure, depending on the lesion vascularization as well as its possible destabilization potential (debridement, capsular suture or foveal reattachment). Unfortunately, too often the radius fracture is insufficiently stabilized by an inadequate fixation process or inappropriate orthopedic management with a positive ulnar variance consequence and an ulnar plus syndrome. A &quot;wafer procedure&quot; may then sometimes be proposed if a shortening of less than 3mm is needed and that the distal radio-ulnar joint is not too disorganized.",Hand surgery &amp; rehabilitation,27890214,2016
Short-term evaluation of arthroscopic outside-in repair of ulnar side TFCC tear with vertical mattress suture.,"BACKGROUND: There has been controversy regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of TFCC tear.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term outcomes of arthroscopic outside-in repair of the ulnar side TFCC tear with vertical mattress suture.METHODS: In this study, arthroscopic outside-in repair of the ulnar side TFCC tear was done. 37 patients with TFCC tear with failure of conservative treatment for a minimum of 6 months had surgery. Outcomes were assessed using modified Mayo wrist score (MMWS), the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and satisfaction criteria, and patient-related wrist evaluation score (PRWE), in addition to the range of motion and grip strength.CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic outside-in repair of ulnar side TFCC tear with mattress suture is a reproducible method with a marked improvement in function within a short period.",Journal of orthopaedics,27857481,2016
Effects on the Distal Radioulnar Joint of Ablation of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tears With Radiofrequency Energy.,PURPOSE: This cadaver study investigated the temperature profile in the wrist joint and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) during radiofrequency energy (RFE) application for triangular fibrocartilage complex resection.METHODS: An arthroscopic partial resection of the triangular fibrocartilage complex using monopolar and bipolar RFE was simulated in 14 cadaver limbs. The temperature was recorded simultaneously in the DRUJ and at 6 other anatomic locations of the wrist during RFE application.RESULTS: The mean temperature in the DRUJ was 43.3 ± 8.2°C for the bipolar system in the ablation mode (60 W) and 30.4 ± 3.4°C for the monopolar system in the cut mode (20 W) after 30 seconds. The highest measured temperature in the DRUJ was 54.3°C for the bipolar system and 68.1°C for the monopolar system.CONCLUSIONS: The application of RFE for debridement or resection of the triangular fibrocartilage complex in a clinical setting can induce peak temperatures that might cause damage to the cartilage of the DRUJ. Bipolar systems produce higher mean temperatures than monopolar devices.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: RFE application increases the mean temperature in the DRUJ after 30 seconds to a level that may jeopardize cartilage tissue.,The Journal of hand surgery,27663055,2016
[Wrist arthroscopy assisted reduction and Herbert screw fixation for the treatment of type B distal radius fractures].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical efficacy of internal fixation with arthroscope assistance in type B fractures of distal radius.METHODS: From June 2013 to July 2015, 28 cases of type B distal radius fracture patients were enrolled into the study, including 15 males and 13 females with an average age of 45.3 years old ranging from 17 to 69 years old. These patients were treated with manipulative and poking reduction wrist arthroscopy, internal fixation with Herbert screws and repair of articular soft tissue, and the course of disease was 4 to 7 days after injury. Injured patients had the typical signs of distal radius fracture with confirming of X ray and CT imaging. Finally, no other fractures, no neurovascular injury, no other severe diseases and no surgical cortraindications were identified. According to the classification of AO/OTA, there were 8 cases of type B1, 7 cases of type B2, 13 cases of type B3. Patients were followed up for fracture healing, wrist joint function recovery, and curative effect.RESULTS: The 28 cases of type B distal radius fractures were followed up with an average of(12.1±1.4) months, all fractures were healed, palmer tilt angle was(15.2±3.4)°, ulnar drift angles was(20.4±6.4)°. Wrist functions were evaluated according to Cooney system and rated as excellent in 21 cases, good in 5 cases and fair in 2 cases. Intraoperative arthroscopy showed the tear of scapholunate ligaments in 3 cases, tear of in lunotriguetal ligaments in 1 case, and TFCC tear in 16 cases.CONCLUSIONS: Wrist arthroscopy assisted treatment of distal radius fracture type B can make the recovery of joint surface roughness to a great extent. The application of Herbert screw brings in the small trauma, and the postoperative recovery time is short, reducing the incidence of traumatic arthritis and preventing the chronic pain or inastbility of the wrist in the future.",Zhongguo gu shang = China journal of orthopaedics and traumatology,29282959,2016

High-Resolution 3T MR Imaging of the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex.,"This study is intended as a review of 3Tesla (T) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). The recent advances in MR imaging, which includes high field strength magnets, multi-channel coils, and isotropic 3-dimensional (3D) sequences have enabled the visualization of precise TFCC anatomy with high spatial and contrast resolution. In addition to the routine wrist protocol, there are specific techniques used to optimize 3T imaging of the wrist; including driven equilibrium sequence (DRIVE), parallel imaging, and 3D imaging. The coil choice for 3T imaging of the wrist depends on a number of variables, and the proper coil design selection is critical for high-resolution wrist imaging with high signal and contrast-to-noise ratio. The TFCC is a complex structure and is composed of the articular disc (disc proper), the triangular ligament, the dorsal and volar radioulnar ligaments, the meniscus homologue, the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL), the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon sheath, and the ulnolunate and ulnotriquetral ligaments.

Effect of ulnar styloid fracture on outcomes after conservative treatment of distal radius fracture.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the effect of accompanying ulnar styloid fracture (USF) on clinical outcomes and hand-wrist muscle strength in conservatively treated active patients after displaced distal radius fracture (DRF).PATIENTS AND METHODS: The retrospective study, which was conducted November 2012 and September 2016, included 56 patients (34 males, 22 females; mean age 28.8 years; range 20 to 40 years) with displaced DRF treated with closed reduction and casting. Patients were divided into three groups according to ulnar styloid status as group A (intact ulnar styloid), group B (USF non-union), and group C (healed USF). Grip strength, quick-disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score, and joint range of motions were evaluated; the results were combined with measurements of isokinetic muscle strengths of hand-wrist region. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate the accompaniment of distal radioulnar joint injury and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesion.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups regarding joint range of motion, grip strength, and quick-DASH scores. However, the peak torque and total work of supination was better in group A compared to group B (p=0.008 and p=0.006, respectively). According to the magnetic resonance imaging findings, of the 10 patients with detected TFCC lesion, four were in group C, five in group B, and one was in group A.CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that USF should not be the focus of attention during initial treatment of DRF and surgical intervention might be considered in case of an accompanying TFCC lesion.",Eklem hastaliklari ve cerrahisi = Joint diseases &amp; related surgery,27499320,2016
[Arthroscopically assisted transcapsular refixation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex of the wrist].,"OBJECTIVE: Refixation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) to the ulnar capsule of the wrist.INDICATIONS: Distal TFCC tears without instability, proximal TFCC intact. Loose ulnar TFCC attachment without tear or instability.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Peripheral TFCC tears with instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Complex or proximal tears of the TFCC. Isolated, central degenerative tears without healing potential.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Arthroscopically guided, minimally invasive suture of the TFCC to the base of the sixth extensor compartment.POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Above elbow plaster splint, 70° flexion of the elbow joint, 45° supination for 6 weeks. Skin suture removal after 2 weeks. No physiotherapy to extend pronation and supination during the first 3 months.RESULTS: In an ongoing long-term study, 7 of 31 patients who underwent transcapsular refixation of the TFCC between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2010 were evaluated after an average follow-up interval of 116 ± 34 months (range 68-152 months). All patients demonstrated an almost nearly unrestricted range of wrist motion and grip strength compared to the unaffected side. All distal radioulnar joints were stable. On the visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10), pain at rest was 1 ± 1 (range 0-2) and pain during exercise 2 ± 2 (range 0-5); the DASH score averaged 10 ± 14 points (range 0-39 points). All patients were satisfied. The modified Mayo wrist score showed four excellent, two good, and one fair result. These results correspond to the results of other series.CONCLUSION: Transcapsular refixation is a reliable, technically simple procedure in cases with ulnar-sided TFCC tears without instability leading to good results.",Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie,27491857,2016
[Arthroscopic partial resection of the ulnar head for ulnocarpal decompression].,"OBJECTIVE: Arthroscopic decompression (wafer procedure) of the ulnocarpal compartment in patients with ulnar impaction syndrome.INDICATIONS: The arthroscopic wafer procedure is recommended in ulnar-plus situations with up to 3 mm length-excess. To perform this procedure the ulnar head needs to be accessible for the burr through a pre-existing, impaction-related, centroradial lesion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). The additional presence of a distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) type C confirms the indication.CONTRAINDICATIONS: The wafer procedure is contraindicated if there is no consistent TFCC injury ensuring access to the ulnar head and furthermore in ulna-plus situations of more than 3 mm. Relative contraindications: in young patients due to lack of evidence-based studies.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Arthroscopic, semicircular, partial resection of the ulnar head in terms of oblique-helicoidal osteotomy using a 4.2 mm burr, while sparing the DRUJ and the dorsal and the palmar radioulnar ligaments.POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Immobilization for 1 week in a palmar splint with immediate intensive exercising of pro- and supination under physiotherapeutic instruction.RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2010, an arthroscopic wafer procedure was performed in 24 patients. The resection of the ulnar head was 2.5 mm on average. After a mean follow-up time of 13.25 months, very good results were archived in 23 of 24 patients; the ulnar impingement test was negative. On a visual analog scale (0-10) average postoperative pain was 1.16 at rest and 4.5 under stress. The mean postoperative DASH score was 13.4.",Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie,27379858,2016
[Arthroscopic refixation of TFCC by bone screw anchor].,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this operation technique is a stable refixation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) to the fovea ulnaris. The stability of the distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ) should be re-established. The patients pain and the feeling of instability should be reduced.INDICATIONS: Lesions of the foveal component of the TFCC resulting in DRUJ instability. Combined lesions of both components of the TFCC. Complete detachment of the TFCC from the ulna either without fracture of the styloid process of the ulna or with fracture (floating styloid).CONTRAINDICATIONS: Severe lacerations of the TFCC and clinically relevant arthrosis of the DRUJ. Severely osteoporotic bone.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Following diagnostic arthroscopy and performance of stability control of the TFCC with a palpation hook, reduction of the DRUJ with supination position of the wrist. Bone anchor fixation through the direct foveal portal (DF). Under arthroscopic control through the 3/4 portal, the suture from the DF portal is placed through the TFCC. Pull out and tie the strands through the 6 U portal.POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Restriction of rotation of the forearm in a Munster cast or special cast brace for 6 weeks. Self-controlled exercise of the wrist after 6 weeks. Physiotherapy and strength building 8 weeks postoperatively.RESULTS: Clinical studies of this technique showed a significant amelioration of pain perception, improved range of motion and DASH score in all patients after anchor fixation. The results are comparable to other techniques. All patients returned to work after the operation. Accordingly, using this technique a very good stabilization of the DRUJ with low complications can be achieved.",Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie,27379856,2016
Biomechanical study of distal radioulnar joint ballottement test.,"We investigated the reliability and accuracy of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) ballottement test using five fresh-frozen cadaver specimens in triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC)-intact, and TFCC-sectioned wrists. The humerus and proximal ulna were fixed. The ulna was allowed to translate in dorsopalmar directions without rotation, and the radius was allowed to move freely. Four sensors of a magnetic tracking system were attached to the radius and ulna, and the nails of each examiner's thumbs. Five examiners conducted the DRUJ ballottement test before and after TFCC sectioning. We used two techniques: With holding and without holding the carpal bones to the radius (holding and non-holding tests, respectively). We compared the magnitudes of bone-to-bone (absolute DRUJ) movement with that of the examiner's nail-to-nail (relative DRUJ) movement. The intrarater intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were 0.92 (holding) and 0.94 (non-holding). The interrater ICCs were 0.84 (holding) and 0.75 (non-holding). Magnitudes of absolute and relative movements averaged 11.5 and 11.8 mm, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Before TFCC sectioning, the DRUJ movement during the holding and non-holding techniques averaged 9.8 and 10.8 mm, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). The increase in DRUJ movement after TFCC sectioning was greater with the holding technique (average 2.3 mm) than with the non-holding technique (average 1.6 mm). The DRUJ ballottement test with magnetic markers is relatively accurate and reliable for detecting unstable joints. We recommend the holding technique for assessing DRUJ instability in clinical practice. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Arthroscopic-assisted repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex foveal avulsion in distal radioulnar joint injury.,"BACKGROUND: Disruption of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) foveal insertion can lead to distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability accompanied by ulnar-sided pain, weakness, snapping, and limited forearm rotation. We investigated the clinical outcomes of patients with TFCC foveal tears treated with arthroscopic-assisted repair.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients underwent foveal repair of avulsed TFCC with the assistance of arthroscopy between 2011 and 2013. These patients were followed up for an average of 19 months (range 14-25 months). The avulsed TFCC were reattached to the fovea using a transosseous pull-out suture or a knotless suture anchor. At the final followup, the range of motion, grip strength and DRUJ stability were measured as objective outcomes. Subjective outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, patient rated wrist evaluation (PRWE), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH score) and return to work.RESULTS: Based on the DRUJ stress test, 5 patients had normal stability and 7 patients showed mild laxity as compared with the contralateral side. Postoperatively, the mean range of pronation supination increased from 141° to 166°, and the mean VAS score for pain decreased from 5.3 to 1.7 significantly. The PRWE and DASH questionnaires also showed significant functional improvement. All patients were able to return to their jobs. However, two patients complained of persistent pain.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopically assisted repair of TFCC foveal injury can provide significant pain relief, functional improvement and restoration of DRUJ stability.",Indian journal of orthopaedics,27293286,2016
[Classification and MR imaging of triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the MRI characteristics of injuries of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), and provide imaging basis for the early diagnosis and treatment of the injuries.METHODS: A total of 10 healthy volunteers without wrist injuries and 200 patients from Beijing Jishuitan Hospital who complained ulnar-sided wrist pain and were highly suspected as the injury of TFCC underwent the wrist magnetic resonance examination. All subjects were in a prone position and underwent examination on coronal T1WI scan and PD-FS on 3 planes respectively. Then the MRI characteristics of 3 healthy volunteers and 67 patients with TFCC injuries that confirmed by operation were analyzed. According to the comparative analysis of normal anatomy and Palmer classification, the injuries were classified and MRI features of different types of injuries were analyzed. At last, imaging findings were compared with surgical results.RESULTS: Three healthy volunteers without injuries showed mainly in low signal intensity on T1WI and PD-FS images. According to Palmer classification, there were 52 traumatic injuries (ⅠA 9, ⅠB 25, ⅠC 3, ⅠD 13, In addition, 1 has central perforation and ulnar avulsion and 1 has ulnar and radial injuries simultaneously) and 15 degenerative injuries (ⅡA 5, ⅡB 1, ⅡC 2 , ⅡD 1 , ⅡE 6) among 67 patients. The central perforation mainly demonstrated as linear high signal perpendicular to the disk, and run in a sagittal line. The ulnar, distal, and radial avulsion mainly showed the injuries were irregular, the structures were ambiguous, and there was high signal intensity in the injured structures on PD-FS. Degenerative injuries demonstrated the irregularity of TFC and heterogeneous signals on PD-FS. There were mixed intermediate-high signals and changes in the articular cartilage of lunate and ulna, high signal in the lunotriquetral ligament and ulnocarpal or radioulnar arthritis.CONCLUSION: MRI can demonstrate the anatomy of TFCC accurately, evaluate and make the general classification of injuries. It is of significance for the early diagnosis and treatment protocols of the TFCC injuries.",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,27290709,2016
Combined Palmer Type 1A and 1B Traumatic Lesions of the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex A New Category.,"We present a series of eight patients who underwent wrist arthroscopy for presumed solitary tears of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) and were, instead, found to have combined 1A (central tear) and 1B (ulnar avulsion) tears. The Palmer Classification does not currently categorize this combined pattern. All but one patient had a traumatic injury. Each subject had preoperative radiographs and MRI scans. TFC tears were evident on all MRI scans, though only one was suggestive of a combined tear pat - tern. Surgical management included arthroscopic central tear debridement and ulnar peripheral repair. Average follow-up was 22 months. Grip strength in the affected hand improved from 16% deficit as compared to the unaffected side, to 3.5% deficit postoperatively (p = 0.003), and visual analog scores (VAS) decreased from an average of 7.1/10 preoperatively to 2.3/10 postoperatively (p &lt; 0.001). There was no statistically significant change in wrist range of motion (ROM), however. Arthroscopic debridement of the central perforation (1A lesion) with concomitant repair of the ulnar detachment (1B lesion) resulted in functional and symptomatic improvement. This combined 1A/1B TFC injury is not reliably diagnosed preoperatively and should be considered a new subset in the Palmer classification, as this will raise awareness of its presence and assist in preoperative planning of such lesions.

Which Fingers Should We Perform Two-Finger Chest Compression Technique with When Performing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation on an Infant in Cardiac Arrest?,"This study compared the effectiveness two-finger chest compression technique (TFCC) performed using the right vs. left hand and the index-middle vs. middle-ring fingers. Four different finger/hand combinations were tested randomly in 30 healthcare providers performing TFCC (Test 1: the right index-middle fingers; Test 2: the left index-middle fingers; Test 3: the right middle-ring fingers; Test 4: the left middle-ring fingers) using two cross-over trials. The &quot;patient&quot; was a 3-month-old-infant-sized manikin. Each experiment consisted of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) consisting of 2 minutes of 30:2 compression: ventilation performed by one rescuer on a manikin lying on the floor as if in cardiac arrest. Ventilations were performed using the mouth-to-mouth method. Compression and ventilation data were collected during the tests. The mean compression depth (MCD) was significantly greater in TFCC performed with the index-middle fingers than with the middle-ring fingers regardless of the hand (95% confidence intervals; right hand: 37.8-40.2 vs. 35.2-38.6 mm, P = 0.002; left hand: 36.9-39.2 vs. 35.5-38.1 mm, P = 0.003). A deeper MCD was achieved with the index-middle fingers of the right versus the left hand (P = 0.004). The ratio of sufficiently deep compressions showed the same patterns. There were no significant differences in the other data. The best performance of TFCC in simulated 30:2 compression: ventilation CPR performed by one rescuer on an infant in cardiac arrest lying on the floor was obtained using the index-middle fingers of the right hand.

[Arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis of intraarticular distal radius fractures].,"OBJECTIVE: Anatomical reconstruction of the distal radius after intra-articular fractures with special consideration of the articular surface and treatment of concomitant ligament injuries.INDICATIONS: Intra-articular distal radius fractures in adults under 65 years of age.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Osteoporotic deterioration of metaphyseal bone, radiocarpal fracture dislocation and open fractures.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Conventional palmar approach for plate fixation of the fracture with a fixed angle locking plate. Arthroscopy of the wrist is performed for reduction of the articular fracture component using the standard 3‑4 and 6R portals. Following temporary Kirschner (K) wire fixation of the fracture, angle stable locking screws are inserted into the most distal portion of the plate. Finally, the intercarpal ligaments and the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are checked for concomitant lesions and if necessary subsequent treatment within the same operation.POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Plaster cast fixation for 4 weeks followed by a physiotherapy program.RESULTS: After arthroscopically assisted reduction of an intra-articular distal radius fracture, 17 out of the 23 patients were available for follow-up examination an average of 31 months after the procedure. The mean disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score was 4.9 and the mean patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) score was 6.0 at final follow-up. Except for wrist flexion, an active range of motion at the wrist as well as forearm rotation of more than 90 % was achieved compared with the uninjured contralateral side. Grip strength averaged 96 % compared with the contralateral side and pain levels under stress varied between 1 and 3 on a visual analog scale (range 0-10).",Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie,27221230,2016
A Non-surgical Intervention for Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tears.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The current literature contains no reports of treatment options other than surgery following failed conservative management of a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear. The purpose of this study is to describe the use of a novel brace as a non-surgical intervention for TFCC tears.METHODS: This paper is a case study of a subject with a magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed TFCC tear. As an alternative to surgery, he consented to wear a novel brace for 12 weeks after conservative management of his injury had failed. His recovery from injury was monitored with a weight-bearing tolerance test and the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) outcome measure.RESULTS: An increase in weight-bearing tolerance and upper extremity use was evident immediately after donning the brace. After 12 weeks, the subject demonstrated a return to normal weight-bearing tolerance and normal DASH outcome measure scores. These improvements were still evident at a 1-year follow-up appointment.DISCUSSION: Utilizing this novel brace resulted in functional status improvement in a subject with a TFCC tear as demonstrated by significant changes in his DASH outcome measure scores. This case study demonstrates the first non-surgical alternative treatment for a TFCC tear after conservative management has failed.

Imaging of Sports-related Hand and Wrist Injuries: Sports Imaging Series.,"Hand and wrist injuries are common occurrences in amateur and professional sports and many of them are sport-specific. These can be divided into two categories: traumatic injuries and overuse injuries. The aim of this article is to review the most common hand and wrist sports-related lesions. Acute wrist injuries are predominantly bone fractures, such as those of the scaphoid, hamate hook, and ulnar styloid. Ligament lesions are more challenging for radiologists and may lead to carpal instability if undiagnosed. Overuse wrist injuries are mainly represented by tendinous disorders, with De Quervain syndrome and extensor carpi ulnaris tendon disorders being the most common among them; however, there are other possible disorders such as impaction syndromes, stress fractures, and neurovascular lesions. Finally, finger lesions, including closed-tendon injuries (mallet and boutonniere injuries, jersey finger, and boxer's knuckle), flexor pulley injuries, and skier's thumb, should also be detected.

Comparison of Modern 3D and 2D MR Imaging Sequences of the Wrist at 3 Tesla.,"PURPOSE: To compare the image quality of modern 3 D and 2 D sequences for dedicated wrist imaging at 3 Tesla (T) MRI.MATERIALS AND METHODS: At 3 T MRI, 18 patients (mean age: 36.2 years) with wrist pain and 16 healthy volunteers (mean age: 26.4 years) were examined using 2 D proton density-weighted fat-saturated (PDfs), isotropic 3 D TrueFISP, 3 D MEDIC, and 3 D PDfs SPACE sequences. Image quality was rated on a five-point scale (0 - 4) including overall image quality (OIQ), visibility of important structures (cartilage, ligaments, TFCC) and degree of artifacts. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of cartilage/bone/muscle/fluid as well as the mean overall SNR/CNR were calculated using region-of-interest analysis. ANOVA, paired t-, and Wilcoxon-signed-rank tests were applied.RESULTS: The image quality of all tested sequences was superior to 3 D PDfs SPACE (p &lt; 0.01). 3 D TrueFISP had the highest combined cartilage score (mean: 3.4) and performed better in cartilage comparisons against 3 D PDfs SPACE in both groups and 2 D PDfs in volunteers (p &lt; 0.05). 3 D MEDIC performed better in 7 of 8 comparisons (p &lt; 0.05) regarding ligaments and TFCC. 2 D PDfs provided constantly high scores. The mean overall SNR/CNR for 2 D PDfs, 3 D PDfs SPACE, 3 D TrueFISP, and 3 D MEDIC were 68/65, 32/27, 45/47, and 57/45, respectively. 2 D PDfs performed best in most SNR/CNR comparisons (p &lt; 0.05) and 3 D MEDIC performed best within the 3 D sequences (p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: Except 3 D PDfs SPACE, all tested 3 D and 2 D sequences provided high image quality. 3 D TrueFISP was best for cartilage imaging, 3 D MEDIC for ligaments and TFCC and 2 D PDfs for general wrist imaging.KEY POINTS: • 3 D TrueFISP is recommended for cartilage imaging of the wrist at 3 T.• 3 D MEDIC is recommended for ligaments and TFCC.• Robust 2 D PDfs should be used in routine protocols. 3 D sequences may be added depending on the clinical question.• 3 D PDfs SPACE is currently inferior.

Arthroscopic grading of common wrist disorders and its role in management.,Palmer devised a classification system to guide treatment of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears in 1989. The main division is between traumatic Type I and atraumatic Type II tears. The wrist arthroscopy makes diagnosis and treatment of ulnar impaction syndrome possible in a less invasive way. Arthroscopy is the most valuable tool for diagnosis and treatment of acute scapholunate and lunotriquetral dissociation. Arthroscopic grading of Kienböck's disease better describes articular damage compared with plain radiographs and can help surgical treatment. The wrist arthroscopy generally makes it possible to make the diagnosis of the chondral lesion before they are visible by the usual imaging. ,Journal of orthopaedics,27047230,2016
The Outcomes of Arthroscopic Repair Versus Debridement for Chronic Unstable Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tears in Patients Undergoing Ulnar-Shortening Osteotomy.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the results of arthroscopic peripheral repair (AR) and arthroscopic debridement (AD) for the treatment of chronic unstable triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears in ulnar-positive patients undergoing ulnar-shortening osteotomy (USO).METHODS: A total of 31 patients who underwent arthroscopic treatments combined with USO for unstable TFCC tears and were followed-up at a minimum of 24 months were included in this retrospective cohort study. Fifteen patients were treated with AR, and 16 patients were treated with AD while at the same time undergoing a USO. Outcome measures included wrist range of motion, grip strength, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) scores, and overall outcomes according to the modified Mayo wrist scoring system. In addition, a stress test to assess distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) stability was performed before and after surgery to compare the 2 cohorts.RESULTS: Both respective cohorts showed significant improvements in grip strength and subjective scores at the final follow-up. Grip strength, DASH, and PRWE scores were better in the AR group than in the AD group. The recovery rate from DRUJ instability observed during the preoperative examination was superior in the AR group.CONCLUSIONS: Both AD and AR of the TFCC combined with USO are reliable procedures with satisfactory clinical outcomes for unstable TFCC tears in ulnar-positive patients. However, AR of the TFCC is suggested if DRUJ stability is concomitantly compromised.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,27039349,2016
Locked volar distal radioulnar joint dislocation.,"INTRODUCTION: Volar dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint is a rare injury which is commonly missed in the emergency departments. A thorough review of literature showed very few reported cases and the cause for irreducibility varied in different cases, Lack of suspicion and improper X-ray can delay the diagnosis.CASE PRESENTATION: Our article discusses a case 40 year old construction worker, who presented to the Emergency with work-related injury, complaining of left wrist pain, deformity and inability to rotate his forearm. X-rays revealed a volar dislocation of distal ulna which was reducible after manipulation under General Anesthesia (GA). The joint was stable after the reduction.DISCUSSION: Isolated dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint can be either volar or dorsal, although dorsal dislocation is more common. The distal radioulnar articulation plays an important role in the rotational movement of the forearm. It allows pronation and supination which are essential for the function of the upper limb. Pronator Quadratus muscle spasm is an important blockade to reduction and was preventing reduction in this case.METHODS: The work has been reported in line with the CARE criteria [9].CONCLUSION: Volar locked dislocation of Distal Radio ulnar joint is a rare injury. High degree of clinical suspicion and proper X-ray is required for prompt detection. The importance of this case is to raise the awareness among physicians in treating these kind of injuries by careful assessment of the patient and radiographs, and to consider pronator quadratus as an important cause for the blockade to reduction.",International journal of surgery case reports,27016647,2016
Anatomical study of the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve (DCBUN) and its clinical relevance in TFCC repair.,"The aim of this study was to define a detailed description of the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve (DCBUN) in particular in relevance to triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) repairs. In 20 formalin-embalmed arms, the DCBUN was dissected, and the course in each arm was mapped and categorized. Furthermore, the point of origin of the DCBUN, that is, from the ulnar nerve in association with the ulnar styloid process, was defined. Finally, the distance between the ulnar styloid process and the branching of the radial-ulnar communicating branch (RUCB) and the first branch of DCBUN was measured. The distance between the origin of the DCBUN in relation to the ulnar styloid process ranges from 55 to 111 mm (mean 87 mm; STD 14 mm). The distance between the ulnar styloid process and the RUCB ranges from 1 to 54 mm (mean 19 mm; STD 12 mm). Finally, the distance between the ulnar styloid process and the lateral distal branch shows a range of -6 to 28 mm (mean 10 mm; STD 9 mm). In general, three dorsal digital nerves (medial, intermediate, and lateral branch), run at the dorsal ulnar aspect of the hand. The RUCB is often less abundant and shows a large amount of variation. No complete safe zone could be identified; the course of the DCBUN suggests a longitudinal incision for the 6R portal. In fact, a more dorsal incision also prevents damage to the main branches of the DCBUN. ","Journal of plastic, reconstructive &amp; aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",26997325,2016
Clinical tests and magnetic resonance imaging have limited diagnostic value for triangular fibrocartilaginous complex lesions.,"INTRODUCTION: The diagnostic value of clinical tests and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for the investigation of triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) lesions is not clear due to a lack of clinical data.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 908 patients who underwent clinical tests and arthroscopy for suspected TFCC lesions at our institution. Further, MR imaging findings concerning the TFCC were gathered. We correlated clinical tests and MR imaging findings with those obtained during arthroscopy, and we calculated sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values.RESULTS: In the whole cohort, the positive predictive values of all clinical tests were low, ranging from 0.53 to 0.55. The ulna grinding test had the highest sensitivity, but lowest specificity. Sensitivity and specificity of the ulnar fovea sign and magnetic resonance imaging were similar, ranging from 0.73 to 0.76, and from 0.41 to 0.44, respectively. To some degree, the diagnostic value seemed to depend on the Palmer class of TFCC lesion.CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, clinical tests and MR imaging findings are of very limited diagnostic value for the diagnosis of TFCC lesions.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,26969464,2016

Arthroscopic-Assisted Outside-In Repair of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tears.,"With advances in surgical instrumentation and techniques, as well as expanding surgical indications, wrist arthroscopy is now being used to treat a variety of conditions previously managed only with open techniques. Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries remain among the most common causes of ulnar-sided wrist pain and can result from both acute and chronic mechanisms of injury. The most common mechanism of acute injury to the TFCC is a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist in a supinated, extended position. In patients with unrelenting pain, swelling, or mechanical symptoms despite a concerted effort at nonoperative management, which often consists of bracing, therapy, or injections, surgical intervention is often indicated. Treatment historically consisted of open exploration and repair; however, recently, arthroscopic-assisted and all-arthroscopic techniques have been described. We describe a safe, reproducible, and reliable surgical technique for arthroscopic-assisted outside-in repair of peripheral TFCC tears. In addition, a specific focus on surgical anatomy, including pearls and pitfalls for protecting the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve, is presented. ",Arthroscopy techniques,26900557,2016
Dorsal Tear of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex: Clinical Features and Treatment.,"Background Several different triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear patterns have been classified through the use of wrist arthroscopy. A tear of the dorsal aspect of the TFCC has been previously reported, but it is not included in Palmer original classification. Our purpose was to describe this type of tear pattern along with the clinical presentation. Methods An isolated dorsal TFCC tear was encountered in seven wrists of six patients (three men and three women; average age was 31 years). All patients were evaluated by physical exam, X-ray, plain axial computed tomography with pronation, neutral and supination position, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with coronal, sagittal, and axial section and arthroscopy. Results The clinical findings varied and included the following: tenderness at the dorsoulnar aspect of the wrist was positive in all wrists, fovea sign was positive in five wrists, and tenderness at the dorsal aspect of the distal radioulnar joint was present in one wrist. Pain with forearm rotation was positive in all wrists. The ulnar head ballottement test induced pain in all wrists, whereas dorsal instability of the ulnar head was present in one wrist with this test. The ulnocarpal stress test was positive in five wrists. Axial and sagittal images on MRI revealed the dorsal tear in five wrists. All wrists were treated with an arthroscopic capsular repair. The final functional outcome at an average follow-up of 16.1 months was four excellent and one good wrist according to the modified Mayo wrist score. Conclusions The aim of this article is to describe our experiences with tears involving the dorsal aspect of the TFCC, which may be misdiagnosed if the surgeon is not cognizant of this injury.

"Biomechanical Analysis of All-Inside, Arthroscopic Suture Repair Versus Extensor Retinaculum Capsulorrhaphy for Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tears With Instability.","PURPOSE: To assess ulnocarpal joint stability after treatment of a peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury with all-inside arthroscopic suture repair (SR), extensor retinaculum capsulorrhaphy with the Herbert sling (HS), and a combination of both (SR+HS).METHODS: Twelve fresh-frozen, age-matched, upper-extremity specimens intact from the distal humerus were prepared. Nondestructive mechanical testing was performed to assess native ulnocarpal joint stability and load-displacement curves were recorded. A peripheral, ulnar-sided TFCC injury was created with arthroscopic assistance, and mechanical testing was performed. Each specimen was treated with SR or HS and testing was repeated. The 6 specimens treated with SR were then treated with HS (SR+HS), and testing was repeated. We used paired Student t tests for statistical analysis within cohorts.RESULTS: For all cohorts, there was an average increase in ulnar translation after the creation of a peripheral TFCC injury and an average decrease after repair. Herbert sling decreased translation by 21%, SR decreased translation by 12%, and SR+HS decreased translation by 26%.CONCLUSIONS: Suture repair plus HS and HS reduce ulnar translation the most after a peripheral TFCC injury, followed by SR alone.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Ulnocarpal joint stability should be assessed clinically in patients with peripheral TFCC injury, and consideration should be made for using extensor capsulorrhaphy in isolation or as an adjunct to SR as a treatment option.",The Journal of hand surgery,26794124,2016
The correlation of initial radiographic characteristics of distal radius fractures and injuries of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"Our purpose was to determine the correlation of initial radiographic parameters of a distal radius fracture with an injury of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. In a prospective study, 85 patients with surgically treated distal radius fractures were included. Wrist arthroscopy was used to identify and classify triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions. The initial radial length and angulation, dorsal angulation, ulnar variance and distal radioulnar distance were measured. Wrist arthroscopy identified a triangular fibrocartilage complex lesion in 45 patients. Statistical analysis did not identify a correlation with any single radiographic parameter of the distal radius fractures with the associated triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries. The initial radiograph of a distal radius fracture does not predict a triangular fibrocartilage complex injury.</AbstractText>: Our purpose was to determine the correlation of initial radiographic parameters of a distal radius fracture with an injury of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.

Concomitant Ulnar Styloid Fracture and Distal Radius Fracture Portend Poorer Outcome.,"The literature on the effect of ulnar styloid fractures (USFs) on concomitant distal radius fractures (DRFs) is mixed. We conducted a study to determine if associated ipsilateral USFs affect outcomes of DRFs. We retrospectively evaluated 315 DRFs treated (184 operatively, 131 nonoperatively) over a 7-year period. Concomitant USFs were identified. Mean follow-up was 12 months. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) outcome scores, and grip strength and wrist range of motion data, were collected. Statistical analysis was performed with Student t test and analysis of variance. Incidence of concomitant USF and DRF was higher (P &lt; .0002) in the operative group (64.6%) than in the nonoperative group (39.1%). Patients with USFs had worse mean (SD) pain score, 1.80 (2.43) versus 0.80 (1.55) (P = .0001), DASH score, 17.03 (18.94) versus 9.21 (14.06) (P = .001), and SF-36 score, 77.16 (17.69) versus 82.68 (16.10) (P = .022). In the operative group, patients with USFs had more pain and poorer DASH Functional scores than patients without USFs. Results were similar in the nonoperative group. There was no difference in healing time between intra-articular and extra-articular fractures or between presence and absence of USFs. Concomitant occurrence of USFs and DRFs-which is associated with worse pain scores and lower functioning compared with USFs without DRFs-should prompt clinicians to counsel patients about delayed recovery.","American journal of orthopedics (Belle Mead, N.J.)",26761916,2016
Palmer Classification and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings of Ulnocarpal Impingement.,"Ulnocarpal impaction (UCI) syndrome is a well-recognized and relatively frequent cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain and limitation of motion. In the setting of negative or questionable negative radiographs and a strong clinical suspicion for UCI, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is helpful in detecting occult disease. Current MRI technology is capable of providing high-spatial-resolution images on multiple planes while manipulating contrast to highlight different tissue types. However, imaging of the triangular fibrocartilage complex has been challenging because of the small and complex components of this structure. In this article, the stages of UCI are discussed with illustrations of the spectrum of MRI findings using Palmer classification as a guideline.

Patients with triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries and distal radioulnar joint instability have reduced rotational torque in the forearm.,"A total of 20 patients scheduled for wrist arthroscopy, all with clinical signs of rupture to the triangular fibrocartilage complex and distal radioulnar joint instability, were tested pre-operatively by an independent observer for strength of forearm rotation. During surgery, the intra-articular pathology was documented by photography and also subsequently individually analysed by another independent hand surgeon. Arthroscopy revealed a type 1-B injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex in 18 of 20 patients. Inter-rater reliability between the operating surgeon and the independent reviewer showed absolute agreement in all but one patient (95%) in terms of the injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex and its classification. The average pre-operative torque strength was 71% of the strength of the non-injured contralateral side in pronation and supination. Distal radioulnar joint instability with an arthroscopically verified injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex is associated with a significant loss of both pronation and supination torque.</AbstractText>: A total of 20 patients scheduled for wrist arthroscopy, all with clinical signs of rupture to the triangular fibrocartilage complex and distal radioulnar joint instability, were tested pre-operatively by an independent observer for strength of forearm rotation.

Wrist Traction During MR Arthrography Improves Detection of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex and Intrinsic Ligament Tears and Visibility of Articular Cartilage.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of traction during MR arthrography of the wrist on joint space widening, cartilage visibility, and detection of tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and intrinsic ligaments.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective study included 40 wrists in 39 patients (25 men, 14 women; mean age, 35 years). MR arthrography was performed with a 3-T MRI system with and without axial traction. Two radiologists independently measured wrist and carpal joint space widths and semiquantitatively graded articular cartilage visibility. Using conventional arthrography as the reference standard and working in consensus, they assessed for the presence of tears of the TFCC, lunotriquetral ligament (LTL), and scapholunate ligament (SLL). Visibility of a tear before traction was compared with visibility after traction.RESULTS: With traction, all joint spaces in the wrist and carpus were significantly widened (change, 0.15-1.01 mm; all p &lt; 0.006). Subjective cartilage visibility of all joint spaces improved after traction (all p ≤ 0.048) except for that of the radioscaphoid space, which was well visualized even before traction. Conventional arthrography depicted 24 TFCC tears, seven LTL tears, and three SLL tears. The accuracy of tear detection improved after traction for the TFCC (98% after traction vs 83% before traction), the LTL (100% vs 88%), and the SLL (100% vs 95%). Tear visibility improved after traction for 54% of TFCC tears, 71% of LTL tears, and 66% of SLL tears.CONCLUSION: Wrist MR arthrography with axial traction significantly improved the visibility of articular cartilage and the detection and visibility of tears of the TFCC and intrinsic ligaments. The results favor more widespread use of traction during MR arthrography of the wrist.",AJR. American journal of roentgenology,26700348,2015
MR morphology of triangular fibrocartilage complex: correlation with quantitative MR and biomechanical properties.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pathology of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) using high-resolution morphologic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and compare with quantitative MR and biomechanical properties.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five cadaveric wrists (22-70 years) were imaged at 3 T using morphologic (proton density weighted spin echo, PD FS, and 3D spoiled gradient echo, 3D SPGR) and quantitative MR sequences to determine T2 and T1rho properties. In eight geographic regions, morphology of TFC disc and laminae were evaluated for pathology and quantitative MR values. Samples were disarticulated and biomechanical indentation testing was performed on the distal surface of the TFC disc.RESULTS: On morphologic PD SE images, TFC disc pathology included degeneration and tears, while that of the laminae included degeneration, degeneration with superimposed tear, mucinous transformation, and globular calcification. Punctate calcifications were highly visible on 3D SPGR images and found only in pathologic regions. Disc pathology occurred more frequently in proximal regions of the disc than distal regions. Quantitative MR values were lowest in normal samples, and generally higher in pathologic regions. Biomechanical testing demonstrated an inverse relationship, with indentation modulus being high in normal regions with low MR values. The laminae studied were mostly pathologic, and additional normal samples are needed to discern quantitative changes.CONCLUSION: These results show technical feasibility of morphologic MR, quantitative MR, and biomechanical techniques to characterize pathology of the TFCC. Quantitative MRI may be a suitable surrogate marker of soft tissue mechanical properties, and a useful adjunct to conventional morphologic MR techniques.",Skeletal radiology,26691643,2015
Histological assessment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"The morphological structure of the seven components of triangular fibrocartilage complexes of 11 cadaver wrists of elderly people was assessed microscopically, after staining with Hematoxylin-Eosin and Elastica van Gieson. The articular disc consisted of tight interlaced fibrocartilage without blood vessels except in its ulnar part. Volar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments showed densely parallel collagen bundles. The subsheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle, the ulnotriquetral and ulnolunate ligament showed mainly mixed tight and loose parallel tissue. The ulnolunate ligament contained tighter parallel collagen bundles and clearly less elastic fibres than the ulnotriquetral ligament. The ulnocarpal meniscoid had an irregular morphological composition and loose connective tissue predominated. The structure of the articular disc indicates a buffering function. The tight structure of radioulnar and ulnolunate ligaments reflects a central stabilizing role, whereas the ulnotriquetral ligament and ulnocarpal meniscoid have less stabilizing functions.

The distal radial decompression osteotomy for ulnar impingement syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: The decompression of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is performed by ulnar translation of the radial shaft proximal to the sigmoid notch, i.e. detensioning of the distal part of the interosseous membrane (DIOM) while containment of the DRUJ is achieved by closed wedge osteotomy of the radius. The osteotomy shortens the radius which entails detensioning of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Facilitating the modified Henry approach to the distal palmar radius a radial based wedge osteotomy is applied. The proximal osteotomy is proximal to the ulnar head and distal osteotomy is proximal to the sigmoid notch to prevent iatrogenic impingement. Ulnar translation of the radial shaft is performed to loosen the DIOM. The closed wedge osteotomy reduces radial inclination which will foster containment of the DRUJ.CONCLUSION: Distal radial decompression osteotomy of the DRUJ preserves DRUJ function while relieving painful impingement. Further surgical interventions are not compromised in case of failure.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,26596267,2015
Mini dorsal incision to the triangular fibrocartilage complex: a new surgical approach.,The purpose of this paper is to describe a mini dorsal approach to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). We describe a mini incision approach which aims to preserve the structure and proprioception of the primary and secondary stabilisers of the wrist joint. This approach requires less dissection and provides adequate exposure to the distal aspect of the TFCC and allows visualisation of the distal radial ulna joint (DRUJ) with complete TFCC lesions. ,"Hand (New York, N.Y.)",26568729,2015
Arthroscopic treatment for ulnar-sided TFCC-tears.,"OBJECTIVE: Ruptures of ulnar-sided triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) often occur in cases of trauma. Golden standard for diagnosis is the arthroscopy of the wrist. TFCC lesions are classified according to their location if traumatic in origin or if degenerative according to their severity.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recent literature has focused on the ruptures of ulnar-sided triangular fibrocartilaginous complex. This article describes conservative, operative and arthroscopic surgical techniques to reconstruct the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex and restore distal radioulnar joint stability.RESULTS: The main therapeutic goal should be the stabilization of the DRUJ by reattachment of the torn ligaments in ulnar-sided ruptures to the deep fibers in the fovea. This reinsertion can be performed by transosseous suture, a suture anchor or open.CONCLUSION: Central TFCC tears are typically located close to the sigmoid notch of the radius and are either traumatic or degenerative in origin. While central TFCC lesions are usually treated by arthroscopic debridement using small joint punches or a bipolar high frequency system, the ulnar TFCC avulsions can also be refixed arthroscopically in different techniques.",European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society,26566794,2015
Wafer Resection of the Distal Ulna.,"The wafer procedure is an effective treatment for ulnar impaction syndrome, which decompresses the ulnocarpal junction through a limited open or arthroscopic approach. In comparison with other common decompressive procedures, the wafer procedure does not require bone healing or internal fixation and also provides excellent exposure of the proximal surface of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. Results of the wafer procedure have been good and few complications have been reported. ",The Journal of hand surgery,26518323,2015
[Plate Osteosynthesis of Distal Ulna Fractures with Associated Distal Radius Fractures Treated by Open Reduction and Internal Fixation. Short-Term Functional and Radiographic Results].,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to describe the indication criteria and operative technique and to present the first conclusions of a prospective study dealing with an assessment of functional and radiographic findings in patients with concurrent fractures of the distal ulna and distal radius; the former was treated by osteosynthesis using an LCP Distal Ulna Plate (De Puy Synthes, USA) and the latter by plate osteosynthesis.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between August 2013 and September 2014, 18 patients (3 men and 15 women; average age, 58 years; range, 25-74 years) with a fracture of the distal ulna and a concurrent distal radius fracture were treated by plate osteosynthesis. The indications for surgery included displaced ulnar styloid base fractures in 10 patients, displaced comminuted fractures of the ulnar head in seven patients and a subcapital fracture of the ulna in one patient. The average follow-up was 9 months, with 13 (72%) patients being followed up for 6 months at least. The outcome of surgery was evaluated on the basis of X-ray views and multiplanar reconstruction of CT scans. Functional results were based on measuring the range of motion at wrist and forearm and hand grip strength and on the scores obtained from the Mayo Wrist Score System and Quick DASH Questionnaire.RESULTS: The average values for wrist and forearm range of motion were as follows: 68° in flexion (60-80°), 71° in extension (40- 90°), 87° in pronation (70-90°), 81° in supination (50-90°). This corresponded to a 92% (74-100%) range of motion at the contralateral wrist and forearm. The average hand grip strength measured with a dynamometer was 80.6% (53-100%) of the gripping force exerted by the unaffected extremity. Post-operative X-ray and CT findings showed good reduction of both distal radius and distal ulna fractures as well as good fragment retention by means of LCP implants. During follow-up complete bone union and full stability of the radioulnar joint were achieved in all patients. The functional outcome of treatment was shown by the average Mayo wrist score and Quick DASH score of 84 (55-100) and 7.4 (0-47.7) points, respectively.DISCUSSION: The functional outcome of treatment in our patients corresponded to the severity of their distal forearm fractures. The patients with more serious distal radius fractures, frequently associated with ulnar head fractures, had poorer functional results than the patients with less serious fractures. According to the AO classification, in the distal radius fractures, prevailing fracture types were 23-C3 (78%) and 23-C2 (16%). In relation to the distal ulna fracture type, the patients with ulnar styloid base fractures had better functional results than the patients with ulnar head fractures, because a fracture of the styloid process does not affect the congruency of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Fractures of the ulnar styloid process base, following distal radius fracture osteosynthesis, were invariably associated with DRUJ instability. This fracture type is always accompanied by injury to the distal radioulnar ligament of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and, in case of a displaced fracture, surgical management is indicated. In agreement with the results of other authors it was found in our study that, when the anatomical position of the distal radioulnar joint had been achieved, both the functional and the radiographic findings were post-operatively very good. The final average values for the range of wrist and forearm motion, hand grip strength and hand and arm function were assessed as very good. CONCLUSIONS The assessment of our results and their comparison with the literature data showed that osteosynthesis of distal ulna fractures with concurrent distal radius fractures managed by open reduction and internal fixation are indicated in displaced fractures of the ulnar styloid process base, displaced comminuted fractures of the ulnar head where fragments interfere with DRUJ congruency, and unstable displaced subcapital fractures of the ulna. The early results of this study provide evidence for the efficiency of plate osteosynthesis in the treatment of distal ulna fractures.",Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca,26516956,2015

Effect of Volarly Angulated Distal Radius Fractures on Forearm Rotation and Distal Radioulnar Joint Kinematics.,"PURPOSE: To examine the effect of volar angulation deformities of the distal radius with and without triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) rupture on forearm range of motion and the kinematics of the ulnar head at the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) during simulated active forearm rotation.METHODS: Volar angulation deformities of the distal radius with 10° and 20° angulation from the native orientation were created in 8 cadaveric specimens using an adjustable apparatus. Active supination and pronation were performed using a forearm motion simulator. Pronation and supination range of motion was quantified with each deformity. In addition, changes in the dorsovolar position of the ulnar head relative to the radius were calculated after simulating each distal radial deformity. Testing was performed with the TFCC intact and sectioned.RESULTS: Volar angulation deformities of 20° decreased the supination range with preservation of pronation. There was no effect of TFCC status on the range of forearm rotation. With the TFCC intact, volar angulation deformities translated the ulna slightly dorsally in pronation and volarly in supination. After sectioning the TFCC, volar angulation deformities of 10° and 20° translated the ulna dorsally throughout forearm rotation.CONCLUSIONS: Volar angulation deformities reduce supination range and alter the DRUJ kinematics. The increased tension in the intact TFCC caused by volar angulation deformities likely prevented the expected dorsovolar displacement at the DRUJ and restricted supination. Dividing the TFCC released the constraining effect on the DRUJ and allowed the ulna to translate dorsally. However, supination remained limited, presumably because of impediment from the dorsally subluxated ulna.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study demonstrated the importance of correcting volar angulation deformities of the distal radius to less than 20° in order to maintain normal range of forearm rotation and to less than 10° to maintain normal DRUJ kinematics when the TFCC is ruptured.",The Journal of hand surgery,26409579,2015
"[Stabilization of the Distal Radioulnar Joint According to Adams: Clinical, and Radiological Results].","BACKGROUND: Stabilization of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) with reconstruction of distal radioulnar ligaments as outlined by Adams is indicated if a refixation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is no longer possible. There is little information given on the results of these procedures in literature.PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze with use of objective and subjective criteria, whether the reconstruction of the radioulnar ligaments according to Adams allows a sufficient re-stabilization of the DRUJ.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 14 patients (9 female, 5 male) with a mean age of 29 (24-62) years underwent an Adams' procedure between 2004 to 2011. After an average follow up of 67 (26-110) months 11 patients could be examined retrospectively regarding functional results and subjective self assessment. As objective parameters assessment of distal radioulnar joint stability, range of forearm rotation and grip strength were measured. Krimmer- and Mayo Wrist Score were evaluated. Subjective parameters as DASH-score, patient's self assessment and pain (verbal and visual analogue scale) were recorded.RESULTS: In 5 patients the DRUJ was stable, in 2 it was lax. According the 4 patients with ongoing instability, one patient reported on improvement, 2 on unchanged instability and one an impaired sensation of instability. In 2 patients clicking during forearm rotation could be provoked. 2 patients suffered from restricted forearm rotation with loss of range of motion of 60 and 70° respectively. Pronation-supination averaged 89% of the opposite side and 99% compared to preoperative. Grip strength averaged 69% of the opposite side. Krimmer-Score was 74, Mayo Wrist-Score 73, and DASH-Score 24 points. Pain at rest on visual analogue scale (0-10) was 3 and 5 with activity. 6 patients had improved, 2 declined and 3 unchanged pain. Patient´s satisfaction rated 0-10 was 8. Eight would undergo again same operation procedure.CONCLUSION: The clinical findings show, that reconstruction of distal radioulnar ligaments according to Adams in patients with DRUJ instability and no repairable parts of TFCC, do not allow to re-stabilize the DRUJ in all patients. There is a need for further investigations trying to re-stabilize the DRUJ.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",26344158,2015
The Clinical Outcome of Anatomical Reattachment of the TFCC to the Ulnar Fovea using an ECU Half-Slip and an Interference Screw.,"We developed an original reattachment technique using a half-slip of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon with a very small titanium interference screw for chronic foveal avulsion of the TFCC. The clinical outcome of 66 wrists with foveal detachment of the TFCC treated by this procedure was examined.A distally based ECU half-slip was harvested, inserted into the TFCC, sutured to the remnant of the TFCC, and pulled out through a 2.5-mm bone tunnel at the centre of the fovea. The ECU half-slip was subsequently anchored to the ulnar fovea with a small titanium interference screw. We evaluated 66 wrists of 65 patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Ulnar variance was neutral in 47 wrists, negative in 5 and positive in 14 wrists. Causes of injury were falls in 34 patients, traffic accidents in 12, sports activities in 9, labour in 2 and unknown in 8 patients. In the positive variance wrists, ulnar shortening was performed before the reattachment. The clinical outcome was evaluated using our original DRUJ evaluating system.Preoperatively, severe wrist pain was reported in 50 wrists and moderate pain in 16 wrists. Severe no-endpoint DRUJ instability was noted in 65 wrists, while 1 wrist demonstrated moderate DRUJ instability. Only 2 wrists had supination loss by 20 degrees. At the final follow-up, no pain was felt in 55 wrists, mild pain in 3 wrists, and 8 patients had moderate pain. One wrist exhibited a 30-degree loss of supination. The DRUJ was stable in 55 wrists, mildly unstable in 3, moderately unstable in 4 and severely unstable in 4 wrists.

[Instability of the distal radioulnar joint: Treatment options for ulnar lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex].,"Injuries of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) may be fatal to the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). This structure is one of the crucial stabilizers and guarantees unrestricted pronosupination of the forearm. A systematic examination is mandatory to diagnose DRUJ instability reliably. A clinical examination in comparison to the contralateral side is obligatory. Plain radiographs are required to exclude osseous lesions or deformities. Computed tomography of both wrists in neutral, pronation and supination is necessary to verify DRUJ instability in ambiguous situations. Based on a systematic examination wrist and DRUJ arthroscopy identify lesions clearly. Injuries of the radioulnar ligaments which entail DRUJ instability, should be reconstructed preferably anatomically. Ulnar-sided TFCC lesions may often cause DRUJ instability. Osseous ligament avulsions are mostly treated osteosynthetically. Ligament tears may be refixated using anchor or transosseous sutures. Tendon transplants are necessary for an anatomical reconstruction in cases of irreparable ruptures. ",Der Unfallchirurg,26239297,2015
Intraoperative Physical Examination for Diagnosis of Interosseous Ligament Rupture-Cadaveric Study.,"PURPOSE: To study the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the diagnosis of interosseous ligament (IOL) rupture in a cadaver model.METHODS: On 12 fresh frozen cadavers, radial heads were cut using an identical incision and osteotomy. After randomization, the soft tissues of the limbs were divided into 4 groups: both IOL and triangular fibrocartilage (TFCC) intact; IOL disruption but TFCC intact; both IOL and TFCC divided; and IOL intact but TFCC divided. All incisions had identical suturing. After standard instruction and demonstration of radius pull-push and radius lateral pull tests, 10 physician evaluators with different levels of experience examined the cadaver limbs in a standardized way (elbow at 90° with the forearm held in both supination and pronation) and were asked to classify them into one of the 4 groups. Next, the same examiners were asked to re-examine the limbs after randomly changing the order of examination.RESULTS: The interobserver reliability of agreement for the diagnosis of IOL injury (groups 2 and 3) was fair in both rounds of examination and the intraobserver reliability was moderate. The intra- and interobserver reliabilities of agreement for the 4 groups of injuries among the examiners were fair in both rounds of examination. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive, and negative predictive values were all around 70%. The likelihood of a positive test corresponding with the presence of IOL rupture (positive likelihood ratio) was 2.2. The likelihood of a negative test correctly diagnosing an intact IOL was 0.40.CONCLUSIONS: In cadavers, intraoperative tests had fair reliability and 70% accuracy for the diagnosis of IOL rupture using the push-pull and lateral pull maneuvers. The level of experience did not have any effect on the correct diagnosis of intact versus disrupted IOL.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although not common, some failure of surgeries for traumatic elbow fracture-dislocations is because of failure in timely diagnosis of IOL disruption.",The Journal of hand surgery,26231483,2015
MR Imaging of the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex.,"MR imaging has emerged as the mainstay in imaging internal derangement of the soft tissues of the musculoskeletal system largely because of superior contrast resolution. The complex geometry and diminutive size of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and its constituent structures can make optimal imaging of the TFCC challenging; therefore, production of clinically useful images requires careful optimization of image acquisition parameters. This article provides a foundation for advanced TFCC imaging including factors to optimize magnetic resonance images, arthrography, detailed anatomy, and classification of injury. In addition, clinical presentations and treatments for TFCC injury are briefly considered. ",Magnetic resonance imaging clinics of North America,26216770,2015
Injuries of the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments as well as the TFCC in intra-articular distal radius fractures. Prevalence assessed with MDCT arthrography.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of injuries of the scapholunate and lunotriquetral interosseous ligaments (SLIL, LTIL) as well as the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in intra-articular distal radius fractures (iaDRF).METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-three patients with acute iaDRF underwent MDCT arthrography. The SLIL and LTIL were described as normal, partially or completely ruptured. Major injuries of the SLIL were defined as completely ruptured dorsal segments, those of the LTIL as completely ruptured palmar segments. The TFCC was judged as normal or injured. Interobserver variability was calculated. Injury findings were correlated with the types of iaDRF (AO classification).RESULTS: In 159 patients (68.2 %), no SLIL injuries were seen. Minor SLIL injuries were detected in 54 patients (23.2%), major injuries in 20 patients (8.6%). No correlation was found between the presence of SLIL lesions and the types of iaDRF. Minor LTIL injuries were seen in 23 patients (9.9%), major injuries in only 5 patients (2.2%). The TFCC was altered in 141 patients (60.5%). Interobserver variability was high for MDCT arthrography in assessing SLIL and TFC lesions, and fair for LTIL lesions.CONCLUSION: In iaDRF, prevalence of major injuries of the most relevant SLIL is about 9% as evaluated with CT arthrography.KEY POINTS: The C-shaped SLIL is built of dorsal, middle and palmar segments. In iaDRF, major SLIL injuries are associated in 8.6% of the cases. In iaDRF, the SLIL remains intact in 68.3% of the cases. IaDRF and SLIL ruptures can comprehensively be depicted with MDCT arthrography. A three-compartment approach is recommended to assess intrinsic ligaments and the TFCC.",European radiology,26139315,2015
The Traumatized TFCC: An Illustrated Review of the Anatomy and Injury Patterns of the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex.,"The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) plays an important role in wrist biomechanics and is prone to traumatic and degenerative injury, making it a common source of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Because of this, the TFCC is frequently imaged, and a detailed understanding of its anatomy and injury patterns is critical in generating an accurate report to help guide treatment. In this review, we provide a detailed overview of TFCC anatomy, its normal appearance on magnetic resonance imaging, the spectrum of TFCC injuries based on the Palmer classification system, and pitfalls in accurate assessment.

Efficacy of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Tests in Diagnostics of Wrist Ligament Injuries: A Systematic Review.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical provocative tests on injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), the scapholunate (SL) ligament, and the lunotriquetral (LT) ligament.METHODS: An electronic literature search of articles published between January 1, 2000, and February 28, 2014, in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was carried out in April 2014. Only studies of the diagnostic performance of MRI and clinical provocation tests using wrist arthroscopy as the gold standard were eligible for inclusion. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist guided the extraction and reporting of data. The methodologic quality of the included articles was assessed with the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. The primary outcome measure was the negative predictive value (NPV) of wrist MRI and provocative wrist tests, which was defined as the probability of an intact wrist ligament given a negative investigation. The question was whether negative results of MRI or provocative tests were enough to safely discontinue further investigation with arthroscopy. A minimum NPV of 95% was considered a clinically relevant cutoff value. The secondary outcome measures were the positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity.RESULTS: A total of 7 articles (327 patients with MRI and 105 patients with clinical tests) were included in this systematic review. The included articles displayed heterogeneity regarding participants, diagnostic methods, and study design. Seven articles investigated the diagnostic performance of MRI, whereas 1 article investigated clinical testing. The NPVs of MRI were as follows: TFCC, 37% to 90%; SL ligament, 72% to 94%; and LT ligament, 74% to 95%. The NPVs of clinical tests were 55%, 74%, and 94% for the TFCC, SL ligament, and LT ligament, respectively. Only 1 study reached the predetermined cutoff value for the primary outcome measure (NPV ≥95%) but only for MRI of the LT ligament; this study also reached a borderline-cutoff NPV of 94% for MRI of the SL ligament. Another study reached borderline-cutoff NPVs of 94% both for MRI and for clinical tests of the LT ligament.CONCLUSIONS: A negative result from MRI is unable to rule out the possibility of a clinically relevant injury to the TFCC, SL ligament, or LT ligament of the wrist. Clinical provocation wrist tests were of limited diagnostic value. The current gold standard--wrist arthroscopy--remains the preferred diagnostic technique with sufficient conclusive properties when it comes to wrist ligament injuries.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, systematic review of Level II diagnostic studies.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,26095820,2015
[Results after Arthroscopically Assisted Management of Intra-Articular Distal Radius Fractures].,"Background/Goal: An arthroscopically assisted management of intra-articular distal radius fractures may improve the quality of reduction. Furthermore, concomitant ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries can be identified and treated. However, this approach increases the duration of surgery. If severe soft tissue lesions, such as SL-ligament disruptions are treated simultaneously, a longer post-operative immobilisation will be required. The aim of this study was to measure the clinical outcome one year after arthroscopically assisted treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures.</AbstractText>: Background/Goal: An arthroscopically assisted management of intra-articular distal radius fractures may improve the quality of reduction. Furthermore, concomitant ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries can be identified and treated. However, this approach increases the duration of surgery. If severe soft tissue lesions, such as SL-ligament disruptions are treated simultaneously, a longer post-operative immobilisation will be required. The aim of this study was to measure the clinical outcome one year after arthroscopically assisted treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study from 2011 to 2013 we identified 27 patients with intra-articular distal radius fractures who were treated with volar fixed angle plates in an arthroscopically assisted fashion. The amount of associated injuries, the duration of surgery and the time of immobilisation were documented. One year postoperatively we evaluated 23 of these patients using several scores. Patient satisfaction, range of motion, visual analogue scale and grip strength were assessed using a standardised questionnaire.RESULTS: The mean surgery time was 111 min (60-190 min). On average, we found 1.4 (0-3) associated injuries per patient. Seventy percent (19) of all patients had a triangular fibrocartilage complex lesion, 67% (16) had some degree of scapholunate ligament lesion. The mean number of interventions in addition to the plate fixation was 1.1 per patient (0-3). Among these were debridements of the triangular fibrocartilage complex in 11 cases (41%) and scapholunate ligament repairs in 4 cases (15%). The mean immobilisation time was 22 (0-42) days. At one year after surgery, the mean Mayo wrist score was 79 (65-95) and the DASH score was 12 (0-49).CONCLUSION: The arthroscopically assisted management of intra-articular distal radius fractures helps to identify and treat associated injuries. However, it results in extended surgery and immobilisation time, especially if concomitant intra-articular lesions are treated. In our group of patients, the clinical outcome after one year was nonetheless very good.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",26084854,2015
Surgical treatment of acute distal radioulnar joint instability associated with distal radius fractures.,"This study investigates the question of whether open repair of acute distal radioulnar joint instability at the time of volar plating of distal radius fractures would enable early mobilization of the wrist without the risk of distal radioulnar joint instability. We evaluated 29 patients of mean age 53 years with a distal radius fracture and acute distal radioulnar joint instability who underwent volar plating of the radius combined with surgical repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex or an ulnar styloid base fracture, followed by active motion exercise of the wrist at 1 week after surgery. At 1 year after treatment, all patients had a stable distal radioulnar joint and grip strength averaged 90% of the normal side. This study demonstrates that surgical repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex or ulnar styloid fracture followed by early mobilization did not result in distal radioulnar joint instability, and suggests that the surgical treatment of distal radioulnar joint instability may permit early mobilization of the wrist in patients who are considered suitable for rapid rehabilitation after surgery.

Immunohistochemical Mapping of Sensory Nerve Endings in the Human Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex.,"BACKGROUND: The triangular fibrocartilage complex is the main stabilizer of the distal radioulnar joint. While static joint stability is constituted by osseous and ligamentous integrity, the dynamic aspects of joint stability chiefly concern proprioceptive control of the compressive and directional muscular forces acting on the joint. Therefore, an investigation of the pattern and types of sensory nerve endings gives more insight in dynamic distal radioulnar joint stability.PURPOSES: We aimed to (1) analyze the general distribution of sensory nerve endings and blood vessels; (2) examine interstructural distribution of sensory nerve endings and blood vessels; (3) compare the number and types of mechanoreceptors in each part; and (4) analyze intrastructural distribution of nerve endings at different tissue depth.METHODS: The subsheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheath, the ulnocarpal meniscoid, the articular disc, the dorsal and volar radioulnar ligaments, and the ulnolunate and ulnotriquetral ligaments were dissected from 11 human cadaver wrists. Sensory nerve endings were counted in five levels per specimen as total cell amount/cm(2) after staining with low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75, protein gene product 9.5, and S-100 protein and thereafter classified according to Freeman and Wyke.RESULTS: All types of sensory corpuscles were found in the various structures of the triangular fibrocartilage complex with the exception of the ulnolunate ligament, which contained only Golgi-like endings, free nerve endings, and unclassifiable corpuscles. The articular disc had only free nerve endings. Furthermore, free nerve endings were the predominant sensory nerve ending (median, 72.6/cm(2); range, 0-469.4/cm(2)) and more prevalent than all other types of mechanoreceptors: Ruffini (median, 0; range, 0-5.6/cm(2); difference of medians, 72.6; p &lt; 0.001), Pacini (median, 0; range, 0-3.8/cm(2); difference of medians, 72.6; p &lt; 0.001), Golgi-like (median, 0; range, 0-2.1/cm(2); difference of medians, 72.6; p &lt; 0.001), and unclassifiable corpuscles (median, 0; range, 0-2.5/cm(2); difference of medians, 72.6; p &lt; 0.001). The articular disc contained fewer free nerve endings (median, 1.8; range, 0-17.8/cm(2)) and fewer blood vessels (median, 29.8; range, 0-112.2/cm(2); difference of medians: 255.9) than all other structures of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (p ≤ 0.001, respectively) except the ulnolunate ligament. More blood vessels were seen in the volar radioulnar ligament (median, 363.62; range, 117.8-871.8/cm(2)) compared with the ulnolunate ligament (median, 107.7; range, 15.9-410.3/cm(2); difference of medians: 255.91; p = 0.002) and the dorsal radioulnar ligament (median, 116.2; range, 53.9-185.1/cm(2); difference of medians: 247.47; p = 0.001). Free nerve endings were obtained in each structure more often than all other types of sensory nerve endings (p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The intrastructural analysis revealed no differences in mechanoreceptor distribution in all investigated specimens with the numbers available, showing a homogenous distribution of proprioceptive qualities in all seven parts of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.CONCLUSIONS: Nociception has a primary proprioceptive role in the neuromuscular stability of the distal radioulnar joint. The articular disc and ulnolunate ligament rarely are innervated, which implies mainly mechanical functions, whereas all other structures have pronounced proprioceptive qualities, prerequisite for dynamic joint stability.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Lesions of the volar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments have immense consequences not only for mechanical but also for dynamic stability of the distal radioulnar joint, and surgical reconstruction in instances of radioulnar ligament injury is important.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,26024577,2015
[Ulnar-sided wrist pain in sports: TFCC lesions and fractures of the hook of the hamate bone as uncommon diagnosis].,"Injuries to the hand and wrist are common sports injuries. The diagnosis and therapy of wrist injuries are becoming more important, especially in increasingly more popular ball-hitting sports, such as golf, tennis and baseball. Ulnar-sided wrist pain is initially often misdiagnosed and treated as tenosynovitis or tendinitis but tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and fractures of the hook of hamate bone, which can also occur in these sports are seldomly diagnosed. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature focussing on TFCC lesions and fractures of the hook of the hamate bone in racquet sports, baseball and golf. A systematic review of the literature was performed in PubMed on the occurrence of TFCC lesions and fractures of the hook of the hamate bone. All studies and case reports were included. Because of the rarity of these injuries there were no exclusion criteria concerning the number of cases. Injuries associated with ball-hitting sports, such as TFCC lesions and fractures of hook of the hamate bone are still underrepresented in the current literature on sports injuries. The diagnosis and treatment of these injuries are often delayed and can severely handicap the performance and career of affected professional as well as amateur athletes.

Arthroscopic Knotless Peripheral Ulnar-Sided TFCC Repair.,"This article describes the indications and technique for all-arthroscopic knotless repair of a peripheral tear to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). The advantage of this technique is that it allows repair of the articular disk back to the fovea of the ulna without any suture knots to irritate the patient. The learning curve is steep, but once learned, this technique can be performed very quickly and is faster. There are no knots to irritate the patient, and in the author's opinion, there is quicker pain relief than with other techniques. ",Journal of wrist surgery,25945301,2015
The Dorsal Triangular Fibrocartilage of the Metacarpophalangeal Joint: A Cadaveric Study.,"PURPOSE: To describe a fibrocartilaginous structure on the dorsal surface of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint.METHODS: A combination of anatomical dissection, histology, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging was undertaken to explore the anatomical structure described, with clinical correlation undertaken by surgical exploration of MCP joints.RESULTS: A dorsal structure of the MCP joint was identified as fibrocartilagenous in composition, triangular in shape, and-together with the volar plate and collateral and accessory collateral ligaments-forming a deepened dorsal fossa in which the metacarpal head invaginated. It was attached to the extensor tendon by loose connective tissue and formed part of the joint capsule.CONCLUSIONS: The dorsal fibrocartilage of the MCP joint is a constant anatomical structure that appears to complement the structural support for the metacarpal head and extensor tendon. Possible functions include stabilization of the extensor tendon, formation of a dorsal fossa, prevention of extensor tendon attrition, and synovial fluid production. Its structure and function may have implications in future development of joint replacement devices.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study adds to the collective knowledge about the precise anatomy of the MCP joint. Reconstructive surgery and, in particular, joint replacement surgery should consider the potential function and importance of this structure when designing interventions on the joint.",The Journal of hand surgery,25944552,2015
Effect of volar angulation of extra-articular distal radius fractures on distal radioulnar joint stability: a biomechanical study.,"The relationship between increased volar tilt of the distal radius and distal radioulnar joint stability was examined. Distal radioulnar joint stiffness was recorded at 10° intervals from 10° dorsal angulation to 20° of volar angulation from the anatomical position of the radius. Tests were performed with the intact radioulnar ligament and repeated after partial and then complete sectioning of the radioulnar ligament at the ulnar fovea. With the intact radioulnar ligament, distal radioulnar joint stiffness increased significantly at 10° and 20° of volar angulation. Partial sectioning of the radioulnar ligament resulted in an approximate 10% decrease of distal radioulnar joint stiffness compared with the intact state, but distal radioulnar joint stiffness still increased significantly with greater volar tilt. Complete sectioning of the radioulnar ligament significantly decreased distal radioulnar joint stiffness, and increasing the volar tilt did not result in increased distal radioulnar joint stiffness. These results suggest that volar angulation deformities of the distal radius should be corrected to 10° of volar tilt when the triangular fibrocartilage complex is intact.

The Function of the Distal Interosseous Membrane and its Relevance to the Stability of the Distal Radioulnar Joint: An Anatomical and Biomechanical Review.,"The purpose of this article is to review functional anatomy and biomechanics of the distal interosseous membrane (DIOM) and its relevance to the stability of the distal radioulnar joint. The intact DIOM constrained dorsal dislocation of the radius, but it seldom constrained palmar dislocation. A residual ulnar translation deformity of the radial shaft in distal radius fractures has the potential to cause the distal radioulnar joint instability when the triangular fibrocartilage complex injury is also present, because it may result in detensioning of DIOM. Ulnar shortening with the osteotomy performed proximal to the attachment of the DIOM had a more favorable effect on stability of the DRUJ compared with the effect of distal osteotomy, especially in the presence of the distal oblique bundle (DOB). The longitudinal resistance to ulnar shortening was significantly greater in proximal shortening than in distal shortening.

Clinical experience with arthroscopically-assisted repair of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex tears in adolescents--technique and results.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report our preliminary results after arthroscopically-assisted repair of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears in adolescent patients.METHODS: All children and adolescents who underwent arthroscopically-assisted repair of a Palmer 1B tear were identified and prospectively evaluated after a mean follow-up of 1.3 years. The postoperative assessment included documentation of clinical parameters, pain score (visual analogue scale, VAS), grip strength and completion of validated outcome scores (Modified Mayo Wrist Score, MMWS; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Inventory, DASH). A total of 12 patients (four males, eight females) with a mean age of 16.3 years at the time of surgery were evaluated.RESULTS: The mean VAS decreased significantly from 7.0 to 1.7 after the procedure. We observed a significant increase of the MMWS after surgery; however, MMWS was still significantly lower at final follow-up when compared to the contralateral side. A mean postoperative DASH score of 16 indicated an excellent outcome after the procedure. DASH Sports and Work Modules showed fair and good overall outcomes in the short-term, respectively. Grip strength averaged 86 % of the contralateral side at final follow-up, with no significant difference being found between both sides.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopically-assisted repair of peripheral TFCC tears in adolescents provided predictable pain relief and markedly improved functional outcome scores. Concomitant pathologies may have to be addressed at the same time to eventually achieve a satisfactory outcome. Sports participation, however, may be compromised in the short-term and should therefore be resumed six months postoperatively.",International orthopaedics,25916955,2015
Total Flavonoids from Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Ktze Protect against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity In Vitro and In Vivo.,"Doxorubicin has cardiotoxic effects that limit its clinical benefit in cancer patients. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of the total flavonoids from Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Ktze (TFCC) against doxorubicin- (DOX-) induced cardiotoxicity. Male rats were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of DOX (3 mg/kg) every 2 days for three injections. Heart samples were collected 2 weeks after the last DOX dose and then analyzed. DOX delayed body and heart growth and caused cardiac tissue injury, oxidative stress, apoptotic damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Bcl-2 expression disturbance. Similar experiments in H9C2 cardiomyocytes showed that doxorubicin reduced cell viability, increased ROS generation and DNA fragmentation, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, and induced apoptotic cell death. However, TFCC pretreatment suppressed all of these adverse effects of doxorubicin. Signal transduction studies indicated that TFCC suppressed DOX-induced overexpression of p53 and phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK. Studies with LY294002 (a PI3K/AKT inhibitor) demonstrated that the mechanism of TFCC-induced cardioprotection also involves activation of PI3K/AKT. These findings indicated the potential clinical application of TFCC in preventing DOX-induced cardiac oxidative stress. ",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,25784945,2015
Arthroscopic foveal repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"Background Foveal disruption of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is associated with distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability. TFCC fixation onto the fovea is the suitable treatment, which is not achieved by conventional arthroscopic techniques. We describe an all-inside arthroscopic technique that uses a suture anchor through distal DRUJ arthroscopy for foveal repair of the TFCC. Materials and Methods Forty-eight patients with TFCC foveal tear and DRUJ instability were selected according to the Atzei-European Wrist Arthroscopy Society (EWAS) algorithm of treatment. Retrospective evaluation included pain, DRUJ instability, range of motion (ROM), grip strength, Modified Mayo Wrist Score (MMWS), and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) Score. Description of Technique DRUJ arthroscopy was performed to débride the TFCC and the foveal area. Under arthroscopic guidance, a suture anchor was inserted via the distal foveal portal to repair the TFCC onto the fovea. Sutures were tied on the radiocarpal surface of the TFCC. Postoperative immobilization of forearm rotation was maintained for 4 weeks. Heavy tasks were allowed after 3 months. Results After a mean follow-up of 33 months, pain improved significantly but remained moderate in four patients, severe in one. DRUJ instability resolved in 44 patients. Wrist ROM increased. Grip strength, MMWS, and DASH score improved significantly. Excellent and good MMWS equaled 83.3%. Forty-one patients (85.5%) resumed previous work and sport activities. As a postoperative complication, five patients experienced neuroapraxia of the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve (DSBUN) with full spontaneous recovery. Conclusions With appropriate indications and patient selection, arthroscopic foveal repair of the TFCC may restore DRUJ stability and provide satisfactory results without significant complications.

Anatomical Reattachment of the TFCC to the Ulnar Fovea Using an ECU Half-Slip.,"Background Since 1998, we treated 25 wrists with foveal detachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) by our original reattachment technique using a half-slip of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon with a very small titanium interference screw. We examine the clinical outcome of this procedure with a minimum of 2 years follow-up. Patients and Methods There were 25 wrists of 24 patients (16 right, 7 left, 1 bilateral, mean age, 34.8 years) with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 2-7 years, average 3.1). There was a neutral ulnar variance in 19 wrists and positive in 6. In the positive-variance wrists, an ulnar shortening was performed to prevent ulnar abutment before the reattachment. The diagnosis of a TFCC injury was done by arthrogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and distal radioulnar (DRUJ) arthroscopy. The clinical outcome was evaluated using our original DRUJ evaluating system. Technique A distally based ECU half-slip was harvested, introduced into the TFCC, sutured to the remnant of the TFCC, and pulled out through a 2.5-mm bone tunnel at the center of the fovea. The ECU half-slip was subsequently anchored to the ulnar fovea with a small titanium interference screw. Results At the final follow-up, 21 wrists had no pain, 3 wrists indicated mild pain, and 1 wrist severe pain. One patient had a loss of supination by 30 degrees. The DRUJ was stable in 22 wrists, moderately unstable in 2 wrists, and severely unstable in 1 wrist. There were 21 excellent, 2 good, 1 fair, and 1 poor results. Conclusions Anatomic reattachment of the TFCC to the ulnar fovea using an ECU half-slip tendon is a promising procedure. This technique is effective for severe DRUJ instability due to chronic foveal avulsion of the TFCC. ",Journal of wrist surgery,25709874,2015
Reconstruction of Chronic Foveal TFCC Tears with an Autologous Tendon Graft.,"Background A triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury can produce distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability. If the foveal attachment is avulsed, it translates distally. The footprint is separated from its origin and will become covered in synovitis, preventing healing. The authors describe a surgical technique for the treatment of instability of the DRUJ due to chronic foveal detachment of the TFCC. Technique The procedure utilizes a loop of autologous palmaris longus tendon graft passed through the ulnar aspect of the TFCC and through an osseous tunnel in the distal ulna to reconstruct the fovel attachment. Patients and Methods We report on nine patients with a mean age of 42. Median follow-up was 13 months. Results The median pain scores measured were reduced from 8 to 3 postoperatively, and all had a stable DRUJ. Conclusions This technique provides stability of the distal ulna to the radius and carpus, with potential for biologic healing through osseous integration. It is a robust, anatomically based reconstruction of the TFCC to the fovea that stabilizes the DRUJ and the ulnar-carpal sag. ",Journal of wrist surgery,25709873,2015
Open repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex from palmar aspect.,"Background Although foveal tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) can be surgically reattached to the fovea via a dorsal approach, the foveal lesion is difficult to visualize from the dorsal side because the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) sheath floor and the superficial dorsal limb of the radioulnar ligament hinders the view of the fovea. Materials and Methods Twenty-one patients with foveal tears were treated by an open repair method from the palmar aspect. Pain, instability, motion, and grip strength were evaluated after a mean follow-up period of 26 months, and each patient was rated according to the Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS). Description of Technique A 4-cm skin incision is made on the palmar aspect of the ulnar fovea. The ulnar fovea is exposed through a transverse capsulotomy of the distal radioulnar joint. The distal aspect of the TFCC is also exposed between the ECU tendon sheath and the ulnotriquetral ligament. After curettage of the scar tissue in the fovea, the deep palmar and dorsal limbs of the TFCC are sutured back to the fovea using a suture anchor technique. Results Foveal TFCC tears could be repaired via a palmar surgical approach without violating the floor of the ECU tendon sheath and the superficial dorsal limb. Excellent results were achieved in 18 patients, and a good result was achieved in three. Conclusions Our result compared favorably with those reported for dorsal approach. The palmar surgical approach facilitates the inspection and repair of the TFCC foveal tears. Level of Evidence IV. ",Journal of wrist surgery,25709872,2015
Arthroscopic knotless anchor repair of triangular fibrocartilage in distal radius fracture.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Lesions of triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) are associated with distal radioulnar joint instability. Arthroscopic treatment of these lesions improves functional outcome of affected patients. The aim of the present work is to evaluate functional and occupational outcome of TCF repair using an arthroscopic knotless anchor device in patients with associated distal radius fracture.MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational, descriptive study was carried out between November 2011 and January 2014 including 21 patients with distal radius fracture and Palmer 1B lesions of TCF (Atzei class 2 and 3) that were treated by arthroscopic knotless anchor (PopLok® 2,8mm, ConMed, USA). Mean follow-up was 18 months. Functional (Mayo Wrist Score) and occupational outcome results were analyzed. Mean age of the group was 43.0±8.8 years, with 19% of the patients being female. There was an associated scapholunate lesion in 5 cases.RESULTS: Functional results reached a mean of 83.4±16.1 points onMayo Wrist Score. Mean sick-leave time was 153.16±48.5 days. Complete occupational reintegration was reached in 89.5% of cases. There were no postoperative complications.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic knotless anchor repair of 1B TFC tears is a minimally invasive method of treatment that improves tension of fixation, avoiding subsequent loosen, in our experience, with few complications and good functional and occupational results.",Revista espanola de cirugia ortopedica y traumatologia,25659917,2015
Functionality after arthroscopic debridement of central triangular fibrocartilage tears with central perforations.,"PURPOSE: To investigate functional and subjective outcome parameters after arthroscopic debridement of central articular disc lesions (Palmer type 2C) and to correlate these findings with ulna length.METHODS: Fifty patients (15 men; 35 women; mean age, 47 y) with Palmer type 2C lesions underwent arthroscopic debridement. Nine of these patients (3 men; 6 women; mean static ulnar variance, 2.4 mm; SD, 0.5 mm) later underwent ulnar shortening osteotomy because of persistent pain and had a mean follow-up of 36 months. Mean follow-up was 38 months for patients with debridement only (mean static ulnar variance, 0.5 mm; SD, 1.2 mm). Examination parameters included range of motion, grip and pinch strengths, pain (visual analog scale), and functional outcome scores (Modified Mayo Wrist score [MMWS] and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand [DASH] questionnaire).RESULTS: Patients who had debridement only reached a DASH questionnaire score of 18 and an MMWS of 89 with significant pain reduction from 7.6 to 2.0 on the visual analog scale. Patients with additional ulnar shortening reached a DASH questionnaire score of 18 and an MMWS of 88, with significant pain reduction from 7.4 to 2.5. Neither surgical treatment compromised grip and pinch strength in comparison with the contralateral side. We identified 1.8 mm or more of positive ulnar variance as an indication for early ulnar shortening in the case of persistent ulnar-sided wrist pain after arthroscopic debridement.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic debridement was a sufficient and reliable treatment option for the majority of patients with Palmer type 2C lesions. Because reliable predictors of the necessity for ulnar shortening are lacking, we recommend arthroscopic debridement as a first-line treatment for all triangular fibrocartilage 2C lesions, and, in the presence of persistent ulnar-sided wrist pain, ulnar shortening osteotomy after an interval of 6 months. Ulnar shortening proved to be sufficient and safe for these patients. Patients with persistent ulnar-sided wrist pain after debridement who had preoperative static positive ulnar variance of 1.8 mm or more may be treated by ulnar shortening earlier in order to spare them prolonged symptoms.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,25617955,2015
The performance of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of triangular fibrocartilage complex injury: a meta-analysis.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of triangular fibrocartilage complex injury through a meta-analysis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted before 1 April 2014. All studies comparing magnetic resonance imaging results with arthroscopy or open surgery findings were reviewed, and 25 studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included. Data were pooled to yield pooled sensitivity and specificity, which were respectively 0.83 and 0.82. In detection of central and peripheral tears, magnetic resonance imaging had respectively a pooled sensitivity of 0.90 and 0.88 and a pooled specificity of 0.97 and 0.97. Six high-quality studies using Ringler's recommended magnetic resonance imaging parameters were selected for analysis to determine whether optimal imaging protocols yielded better results. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of these six studies were 0.92 and 0.82, respectively. The overall accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging was acceptable. For peripheral tears, the pooled data showed a relatively high accuracy. Magnetic resonance imaging with appropriate parameters are an ideal method for diagnosing different types of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",25600854,2015
Volar subluxation of the ulnar head in dorsal translation deformities of distal radius fractures: an in vitro biomechanical study.,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the effects of dorsal translation deformities of the distal radius with and without dorsal angulation on volar displacement of the ulnar head during simulated active forearm rotation, both with the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) intact and sectioned conditions.METHODS: Eight fresh-frozen cadaveric upper extremities were mounted in an active forearm motion simulator, and distal radial deformities of 0, 5, and 10 mm of dorsal translation with 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees of dorsal angulation were simulated. Volar displacement of the ulnar head at the distal radioulnar joint as a result of each distal radial deformity was quantified during simulated active supination. The data were collected with the TFCC intact and after sectioning the TFCC at its ulnar insertion.RESULTS: Increasing isolated dorsal translation deformities increased volar displacement of the ulnar head when the TFCC was intact (P &lt; 0.001). Increasing dorsal translation combined with dorsal angulation increased volar displacement of the ulnar head compared with isolated dorsal angulation deformities (P &lt; 0.001). Sectioning the TFCC increased the volar displacement of the ulnar head caused by each distal radial deformity (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the clinical importance of evaluating the magnitude of both dorsal translation and dorsal angulation when managing displaced distal radius fractures and malunions.",Journal of orthopaedic trauma,25591036,2015
"Update TFCC: histology and pathology, classification, examination and diagnostics.","The TFCC is a crucial stabilizer of the DRUJ. Based on its superficial and deep fibers, the TFCC guarantees unrestricted pronation and supination which is essential for performing sophisticated tasks. The ability to perform complex movements is of uppermost importance for hand function. Therefore, a functional intact TFCC is a prerequisite in this context. The articular disc of the TFCC is a fibrocartilaginous extension of the superficial zone of hyaline articular cartilage which arises from the radius. The peripheral 10-40 % of the TFC is vascularized. Degeneration of the articular disc is common with increasing age. Even though the central part of the articular disc is avascular, potential regeneration of lesions could be detected. The Palmer and Atzei classifications of TFCC lesions are complementary. TFCC innervation is based on different nerves. There is a high variability. A diligent clinical examination facilitates specific tests which help to allocate symptoms to the pathology. Therefore, a thorough clinical examination is not dispensable. Wrist arthroscopy remains the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosing TFCC pathologies despite technical progress in imaging modalities. MR arthrography may have the potential to become a real alternative to wrist arthroscopy for diagnosing TFCC pathologies with technical progress in the future.

Anatomic dorsal and volar radioulnar ligament reconstruction with Mersilene augmentation for distal radioulnar joint instability.,"Instability of the distal ulna is a fairly common problem after acute distal radius fracture (DRF), distal radius malunion, triangular fibrocartilage complex injury, and a host of other types of trauma. We present a new anatomic technique to stabilize the distal ulna with a tendon graft augmented with Mersilene tape, which has been used primarily to treat unidirectional (dorsal or volar) instability, but could be used for global instability as well. Of the 12 patients who underwent this procedure, 9 had stability fully restored and the remaining 3 had only mild instability after surgery. The procedure is an effective treatment for distal radioulnar joint instability and we believe that this surgical technique will be a valuable adjunct to the existing described procedures for hand surgeons. We present a retrospective single-surgeon case series with outcome measures. ",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,25575187,2015
"Ulnar Impaction Syndrome: A case series investigating the appropriate diagnosis, management, and post-operative considerations.","Ulnar sided wrist pain is a common site for upper extremity disability. Ulnar impaction syndrome results in a spectrum of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries and associated lunate, triquetrum, and ligamentous damage. Patients commonly present with insidious ulnar sided wrist pain and clicking, and a history of trauma or repetitive axial loading and rotation. In this case series, three patients presented to a sports chiropractor for evaluation and were subsequently diagnosed with ulnar impaction syndrome. Treatment strategies consist of conservative management, arthroscopic debridement or repair, arthroscopic wafer procedure, or ulnar shortening osteotomy. For the athlete, intervention should be individualized and sport-specific, considering athletic priorities, healing potential, return to play, and long-term health concerns.

Computed tomography arthrography using a radial plane view for the detection of triangular fibrocartilage complex foveal tears.,"PURPOSE: To classify triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) foveal lesions on the basis of computed tomography (CT) arthrography using a radial plane view and to correlate the CT arthrography results with surgical findings. We also tested the interobserver and intra-observer reliability of the radial plane view.METHODS: A total of 33 patients with a suspected TFCC foveal tear who had undergone wrist CT arthrography and subsequent surgical exploration were enrolled. We classified the configurations of TFCC foveal lesions into 5 types on the basis of CT arthrography with the radial plane view in which the image slices rotate clockwise centered on the ulnar styloid process. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were calculated for each type of foveal lesion in CT arthrography to detect foveal tears. We determined interobserver and intra-observer agreements using kappa statistics. We also compared accuracies with the radial plane views with those with the coronal plane views.RESULTS: Among the tear types on CT arthrography, type 3, a roundish defect at the fovea, and type 4, a large defect at the overall ulnar insertion, had high specificity and positive predictive value for the detection of foveal tears. Specificity and positive predictive values were 90% and 89% for type 3 and 100% and 100% for type 4, respectively, whereas sensitivity was 35% for type 3 and 22% for type 4. Interobserver and intra-observer agreement was substantial and almost perfect, respectively. The radial plane view identified foveal lesion of each palmar and dorsal radioulnar ligament separately, but accuracy results with the radial plane views were not statistically different from those with the coronal plane views.CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography arthrography with a radial plane view exhibited enhanced specificity and positive predictive value when a type 3 or 4 lesion was identified in the detection of a TFCC foveal tear compared with historical controls.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic II.",The Journal of hand surgery,25542437,2014
Load transfer at the distal ulna following simulated distal radius fracture malalignment.,"PURPOSE: To measure the effects of distal radius malalignment on loading at the distal ulna.METHODS: Using an adjustable mechanism to simulate angulated and translated malalignments, clinically relevant distal radius deformities were simulated in a cadaveric model. A custom-built load cell was inserted just proximal to the native ulna head to measure the resultant force and torque in the distal ulna. Loads were measured before and after transecting the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).RESULTS: There was an increase in distal ulna load and torque with increasing dorsal translation and angulation. Combined conditions of angulation and translation increased force and torque in the distal ulna to a greater extent than with either condition in isolation. Transecting the TFCC resulted in a reduction in distal ulna load and torque.CONCLUSIONS: A progressive increase in load at the distal ulna was observed with increasing severity of malalignment, which may be an important contributor to residual ulnar wrist pain and dysfunction. However, no clear-cut threshold of malalignment of a dorsally angulated and translated distal radius fracture was identified. These observations suggest that radius deformities cause articular incongruity, which increases TFCC tension and distal radioulnar joint load. Cutting of the TFCC decreased distal ulna loading, likely by releasing the articular constraining effect of the TFCC on the distal radioulnar joint, allowing the radius to rotate more freely with respect to the ulna.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Anatomical reduction of a distal radius fracture minimizes the forces in the distal ulna and may reduce residual ulnar wrist pain and dysfunction.",The Journal of hand surgery,25499840,2014
Force variations in the distal radius and ulna: effect of ulnar variance and forearm motion.,"PURPOSE: To better define normal wrist joint forces during wrist motion and forearm motion at specific wrist and forearm positions and to see if there is a relationship between these forces and the amount of ulnar variance. A secondary purpose was to determine the relationship between the thickness of the articular disk of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and the amount of force transmitted through the distal ulna.METHODS: Multi-axis load cells were attached to the distal radius and ulna of 9 fresh cadaver forearms. The axial radial and ulnar compressive forces were recorded while each wrist was moved through wrist and forearm motions using a modified wrist joint simulator. During each motion, the tendon forces required to cause each motion were recorded. The ulnar variance and triangular fibrocartilage complex articular disc thickness were measured.RESULTS: The axial force through the distal ulna and the wrist extensor forces were greatest with the forearm in pronation. No relationship was found between the amount of force through the distal ulna and the amount of ulnar variance. A strong inverse relationship was found between the triangular fibrocartilage complex thickness and the ulnar variance.CONCLUSIONS: Wrists with positive ulnar variance have generally been thought to transmit greater loads across the distal ulna, which has been felt to predispose these wrists to the development of ulnar impaction. The results of this study appear to show that all wrists have similar loading across the distal ulna regardless of ulnar variance. By comparison, pronation relatively increases loading across the distal ulna.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Because these results suggest that within reasonable ranges of ulnar variance loading across the distal ulna is independent of ulnar variance, the clinically observed incidence of ulnar impaction is more likely the result of increased wear on a thinner and less durable triangular fibrocartilage complex than due to increased distal ulna loading in ulnar positive variant wrists.",The Journal of hand surgery,25459378,2014
Nonspecific wrist pain in gymnasts and cheerleaders.,"Participation in gymnastics and other upper extremity weight-bearing sports frequently requires athletes to bear significant loads through their wrists. This requirement makes wrist pain and injury of significant concern to competitive gymnasts. Athletes' wrist pain, and their ultimate evaluation and treatment, are subject to many variables. Diagnosing the cause of wrist pain in a gymnast requires understanding of the interplay between sport-specific mechanics imparted to the wrist and the individual athlete's characteristics. Treatment entails the appropriate use of conservative measures or surgical intervention with an emphasis on collaborating with all members of the patient's treatment and training team.

Evaluation of antioxidant-associated efficacy of flavonoid extracts from a traditional Chinese medicine Hua Ju Hong (peels of Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck).,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hua Ju Hong (HJH, peels of Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck) is a popularly used traditional Chinese medicine recorded by &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; (Ben Cao Gang Mu) in Ming Dynasty of China (1578 A.D.). With flavonoid components, HJH possesses hypolipidemic effect associated with antioxidation action. However, no report was found regarding the flavonoid profile and antioxidant activity of HJH.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five purified flavonoid extracts (TFCA, TFCB, TFCC, TFCD and TFCE.) were obtained from HJH using Ca(OH)2 and HPD-300 macroporous resins, and their total flavonoids and representative flavonoid components were analyzed. In vitro tests of DPPH free radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and total antioxidant activity of each extract were evaluated. The most effective extract was selected for in vivo antioxidative evaluation using a rat hyperlipemia model.RESULTS: The total flavonoid content was varying among each HJH extract and decreased in an order of TFCB&gt;TFCD&gt;TFCC&gt;TFCE&gt;TFCA. TFCB, TFCD, and TFCC contained more than 50% of total flavonoids, the highest content of which was found in TFCB (80.7%). HPLC analysis showed that the contents of three flavonoid components, narirutin, naringin and neohesperidin, displayed a similar trend as that of total flavonoids. In vitro antioxidative tests determined that TFCB at 0.24 to 1.2mg/ml possessed the most significant antioxidant effects among other extracts and was also superior to BHT. In vivo experiment also revealed the significant antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic activities of TFCB started from 50 to 200mg/kg after oral administration to hyperlipemia rats. These results indicate that TFCB with the highest flavonoid contents has the strongest antioxidant-associated activities.CONCLUSION: This is the first report regarding antioxidant-associated activities and relevant flavonoid components of HJH extracts, providing a promising candidate of traditional Chinese medicine for antioxidative treatment.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,25446585,2014
Anatomical transosseous fixation of the deep and superficial fibers of the radioulnar ligaments.,"INTRODUCTION: The triangular fibrocartilage complex is in conjunction with the interosseous membrane the most important stabilizer of the distal radioulnar joint. Lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex may cause instability of the distal radioulnar joint with serious consequences. Therefore, the goal is to reconstruct and provide stability to prevent further harm.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Based on the anatomical configuration of the radioulnar ligaments, we present a technique which addresses both the deep and the superficial fibers of the radioulnar ligaments. This surgical procedure can be performed either openly or arthroscopically assisted. Two osseous 2-mm tunnels starting from the ulnar neck to the foveal surface are created. A nonabsorbable suture is passed through the tunnels and the triangular fibrocartilage using a 20-gauge venipuncture needle in order to attach the deep fibers. Then a third osseous tunnel starting from the lateral base of the styloid process to the medial aspect is created. The suture is passed through this tunnel and through the triangular fibrocartilage and around the styloid process palmarily using the same needle as before in order to anchor the superficial fibers anatomically. After reducing the ulna head the sutures are tightened.CONCLUSION: This technique is quite simple and addresses the anatomical configuration of the radioulnar ligaments.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,25380839,2014
Morphology of the extensor carpi ulnaris groove and tendon.,"PURPOSE: Injury to the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) fascial supports on the distal ulna can result in ulnar-sided wrist pain, particularly when the tendon subluxates medially out of the fibroosseous groove with forearm rotation. To better understand the potential risk factors for injury and the indications for modifying the ECU groove, we have evaluated and quantified the morphology of the ECU groove and tendon.METHODS: Axial plane magnetic resonance imaging of the wrist obtained for triangular fibrocartilage complex and intercarpal pathology in 60 patients were reviewed. Mean and standard error of the mean were calculated and unpaired Student t tests performed to compare groove width and depth, radius of curvature of the groove, carrying angle, and tendon-to-groove ratio.RESULTS: There were 23 females (38%), and the mean patient age was 40 years (range, 17-71 y). The average ECU groove depth and standard error of the mean was 1.4 mm ± 0.1 mm. The radius of curvature for the ulnar ECU groove was found to be 7.0 mm ± 0.4 mm with a carrying angle of 143° ± 2°. In neutral forearm rotation, the average ratio of the width of the ECU tendon to groove was 0.7 ± 0.02. The data approximated a normal distribution. There were no statistically significant differences in these measurements between the triangular fibrocartilage complex and the intercarpal pathology subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: Variability in the relationship of the ECU groove and tendon may combine to represent risk factors for tendinosis or tendon subluxation. There may be a more normal distribution of ECU groove morphology than previously recognized.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: ECU injuries may require clinical imaging of the tendon and subsheath, in addition to potential surgical reconstruction and ulnar groove deepening. This report establishes the normative morphology and depth of the ECU groove and provides a comparative baseline when considering treatment modalities.",The Journal of hand surgery,25306505,2014
[Detection of intrinsic ligament and TFCC lesions of the wrist. Direct versus indirect MRI arthrography].,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to validate the diagnostic value of direct magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) arthrography and indirect MRI (iMRI) arthrography concerning intrinsic ligament injuries and tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized prospective trial was conducted with patients who presented with wrist pain potentially due to carpal lesions and 10 patients aged 19-60 years (3 female and 7 male) were included. Between the clinical examination and the diagnostic and therapeutic arthroscopy, dMRI and iMRI arthrography were performed for the diagnostics of injuries of the intrinsic ligaments or the TFCC. The results of dMRI and iMRI arthrography were evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the injuries of the patients and a consensus was reached. The results were compared with the findings obtained by arthroscopy.RESULTS: In the arthroscopy five lesions of the scapholunate ligament (SL), one of the lunotriquetral ligament (LT) and seven of the TFCC were identified. The sensitivity of iMRI and dMRI for carpal ligament lesions (SL and LT) was low (50 %) whereas the specificity was high (93 %). For injuries of the TFCC the sensitivity (up to 100 %) and the specificity (100 %) were both excellent. The area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was high for TFCC lesions in both dMRI and iMRI arthrography.CONCLUSION: Indirect MRI arthrography is a suitable method for detection of injuries of the TFCC and intrinsic ligaments of the wrist with good sensitivity and specificity. Despite the low number of patients the results of this study showed that there were no essential differences between dMRI and iMRI arthrography with respect to the diagnostic value for carpal injuries of the wrist.",Der Unfallchirurg,25294560,2014
Arthroscopy of the distal radioulnar joint.,"Wrist arthroscopy is now widely indicated for diagnosis and treatment of acute or chronic wrist pain, especially for triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions, as a gold standard. In most cases radiocarpal and midcarpal arthroscopy was performed, while DRUJ arthroscopy has been rarely performed because of its difficulties. Recent anatomic and biomechanical studies demonstrated that the radioulnar ligament (RUL), which is the proximal component of the TFCC facing to the DRUJ, is the primary stabilizer of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Rupture of the radioulnar ligament (RUL) at the fovea area, where it is the main attaching portion to the ulna and is the isometric point during forearm rotation as the rotation axis passes, is responsible for DRUJ instability. Although physical examination and imaging diagnosis may indicate a foveal detachment of the TFCC, DRUJ arthroscopy is potential for visualizing the RUL at the fovea. Role of DRUJ arthroscopy should be more important not only for diagnosis of rupture of the RUL but also for decision making of treatment option for RUL tear. DRUJ arthroscopy also demonstrates the joint surface of both the sigmoid notch and ulnar head, and the proximal surface of the TFCC.

[Arthroscopic repair for ulnar-sided tears of the TFCC].,"Accurately performed anatomic and biomechanical studies as well as clinical experience during the last years have widened our knowledge about function and pathology of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) making a differentiated treatment possible. In cases of trauma a rupture of the ulnar part of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) frequently occurs. An overview is given on the development of different arthroscopic techniques for repair and the state of the art is presented. The ulnar part of the TFCC is constituted of the superficial part which is less important for stability and the deep part which is anchored to the fovea of the ulnar head. This deep part is the most important stabiliser of the DRUJ. Each of these parts may rupture separately or both of them may rupture at the same time. Keystones for diagnosis are clinical examination and arthroscopy. On clinical examination instability of the DRUJ is to be evaluated by comparing it to the contralateral side. Furthermore, the degree of instability should be estimated. Extraarticular associated lesions must also be assessed clinically. On arthroscopy the TFCC may be evaluated from the radiocarpal joint as well as from its undersurface, from the DRUJ. In cases of avulsion from the fovea, an anatomic reconstruction with reinsertion of the deep part to the bone is indicated and may be performed successfully according to the published studies and our own experience. If a severe instability is found on clinical examination it is to be supposed that more stabilising structures - then only the radioulnar ligaments - are affected and reinsertion of the deep fibres to the fovea may not be sufficient.

A rare combination: locked volar distal radio-ulnar joint dislocation with isolated volar capsule rupture.,"Distal Radioulnar Joint (DRUJ) dislocation is a commonly missed injury. A high clinical suspicion is required as the dislocation may not be obvious in the conventional views of radiographs. Volar DRUJ dislocations are far less common than the dorsal ones. Since triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is the major stabilizer of DRUJ, it is common that the irreducible DRUJ dislocation is associated with TFCC tear. We report a patient who had irreducible volar DRUJ dislocation blocked by the volar lip of sigmoid notch, with only isolated volar capsule rupture.

Sympathomimetic amine therapy found effective for treatment of refractory chronic complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy).,"PURPOSE: To determine if treatment with sympathomimetic amines could improve the pain from complex regional pain disorder (CRPD) which was keeping a woman from trying to conceive her second child.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dextroamphetamine sulfate was prescribed.RESULTS: Within a short length of time the woman's wrist pain considerably improved to the point that she is ready to try in vitro fertilization once again to have a second baby.CONCLUSIONS: Though sympathomimetic amines are used by some reproductive endocrinologists for unexplained infertility and unexplained recurrent miscarriages, the most common use by the gynecologist is for pelvic pain. Despite the thought by some clinicians and researchers that the etiology for CRPD may be related to sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity (and thus sympathomimetic amines could theoretically exacerbate the symptoms), in fact, the treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate may turn out to be a new and possibly the most effective, least risky, and least expensive treatment to date for CRPD.",Clinical and experimental obstetrics &amp; gynecology,25134306,2014
How does ulnar shortening osteotomy influence morphologic changes in the triangular fibrocartilage complex?,"BACKGROUND: Ulnar shortening osteotomy often is indicated for treatment of injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). However, the effect of ulnar shortening osteotomy on the changes in shape of the TFCC is unclear. In our study, quantitative evaluations were performed using MRI to clarify the effect of ulnar shortening on triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) thickness attributable to disc regeneration of the TFC and TFC angle attributable to the suspension effect of ulnar shortening on the TFC.PURPOSES: The purposes of this study were (1) to compare preoperative and postoperative TFC thickness and TFC angle on MR images to quantitatively evaluate the effect of ulnar shortening osteotomy on disc regeneration and the suspension effect on the TFC; and (2) to assess whether changes in TFC thickness and TFC angle correlated with the Mayo wrist score.METHODS: Between 1995 and 2008, 256 patients underwent ulnar shortening osteotomy for TFCC injuries. The minimum followup was 24 months (mean, 51 months; range, 24-210 months). A total of 79 patients (31%) with complete followup including preoperative and postoperative MR images and the Mayo wrist score was included in this retrospective study. Evaluation of the postoperative MR images and the Mayo wrist score were performed at the final followup. The remaining 177 patients did not undergo postoperative MRI, or they had a previous fracture, large tears of the disc proper, or were lost to followup. Two orthopaedists, one of whom performed the surgeries, measured the TFC thickness and the TFC angle on coronal MR images before and after surgery for each patient. Correlations of the percent change in the TFC thickness and the magnitude of TFC angle change with age, sex, postoperative MR images, extent of ulnar shortening, preoperative ulnar variance, and postoperative Mayo wrist score were assessed.RESULTS: Stepwise regression analysis showed a correlation between the percent change in TFC thickness and preoperative ulnar variance (R2=0.21; β=-0.33; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.01; p=0.01) and between the magnitude of change in the TFC angle and the extent of ulnar shortening (R2=0.18; β=-0.29; 95% CI, -5.8 to 0.29; p=0.03). The Mayo wrist score was not correlated with the percent change in TFC thickness or the magnitude of change in the TFC angle.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in patients with TFCC injury with a smaller preoperative ulnar variance, a high residual potential for regeneration in the disc proper was seen after ulnar shortening osteotomy, and correlated with the extent of ulnar shortening and the suspension effect on TFC. However, there was no correlation between disc regeneration or the suspension effect on TFC and the Mayo wrist score.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

Comparison of conventional MRI and MR arthrography in the evaluation wrist ligament tears: A preliminary experience.,"AIMS: To compare conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography in the evaluation of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and intrinsic wrist ligament tears.MATERIALS AND METHODS: T1-weighted, fat suppressed (FS) proton density plus T2-weighted (FS PD/T2), 3D multiple-echo data image combination (MEDIC) sequences and direct MR arthrography were performed in 53 patients with wrist pain. Images were evaluated for the presence and location of TFCC, scapholunate ligament (SLL) and lunatotriquetral ligament (LTL) tears, and imaging findings were compared with operative findings in 16 patients who underwent arthroscopy or open surgery (gold standard).RESULTS: SIXTEEN PATIENTS UNDERWENT ARTHROSCOPY/OPEN SURGERY: 12 TFCC tears were detected arthroscopically out of which 9 were detected on FS PD/T2 sequence, 10 on MEDIC sequence, and all 12 were detected on MR arthrography. The sensitivities of FS PD/T2, MEDIC sequences, and MR arthrography in the detection of TFCC tears were 75%, 83.3%, and 100%, respectively. Out of the eight arthroscopically confirmed SLL tears, three tears were detected on FS PD/T2 sequence, five on MEDIC sequence, and all eight were visualized on MR arthrography. The sensitivities of FS PD/T2, MEDIC sequences, and MR arthrography in detecting SLL tears were 37.5%, 62.5%, and 100%, respectively. One arthroscopically confirmed LTL tear was diagnosed on FS PD/T2 sequence, three on MEDIC sequence, and all five arthroscopically confirmed LTL tears were detected with MR arthrography. The sensitivities of PD, MEDIC sequences, and MR arthrography in detecting LTL tears were 20%, 40%, and 100%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: MR arthrography is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for the evaluation of wrist ligament tears.",The Indian journal of radiology &amp; imaging,25114389,2014
Prevalence of triangular fibrocartilage complex abnormalities regardless of symptoms rise with age: systematic review and pooled analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Triangular fibrocartilage complex abnormalities seem to be more common with age, but the degree to which this is so, and the degree to which the presence of an abnormality is associated with symptoms, are topics of controversy.PURPOSES: We wished to perform a systematic review to determine the prevalence of triangular fibrocartilage complex abnormalities, and to determine if the prevalence of abnormalities are greater with increasing age. In addition, we stratified age groups based on symptoms.METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library through August 15, 2013. Studies that reported triangular fibrocartilage complex abnormalities by age were included. Fifteen studies including 977 wrists met our criteria and reported a total of 368 (38%) triangular fibrocartilage complex abnormalities. Eight studies included symptomatic patients; the remainder studied cadavers (six studies) or asymptomatic volunteers (one study). Patients were divided into four age groups (&lt; 30, 30-49, 50-69, and 70 years and older) for pooled analysis, comparing the proportions of patients with and without abnormalities between groups using chi-square analysis. We also evaluated the proportions after stratifying each age group by symptoms.RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of triangular fibrocartilage complex abnormalities increased with age, from 27% (80/301) in patients younger than 30 years to 49% (130/265) in patients 70 years and older (p &lt; 0.001), odds ratio (OR), 2.7, 95% CI, 1.9-3.8 (p &lt; 0.001). In asymptomatic patients, triangular fibrocartilage complex prevalence abnormality increased from 15% (24/159) to 49% (129/263) in the same age groups (p &lt; 0.001), OR, 5.4, 95% CI, 3.3-8.9 (p &lt; 0.001). For symptomatic patients prevalence ranged from 39% (56/142) to 70% (14/20) in patients between 50 and 69 years old (p &lt; 0.034), OR, 3.6, 95% CI, 1.3-9.9 (p &lt; 0.014).CONCLUSION: Triangular fibrocartilage complex abnormalities are common in symptomatic and asymptomatic wrists, and they are increasingly common with age. As in all situations where abnormalities are so common that they may be incidental, we need (1) a reliable and accurate method for determining whether these abnormalities are the cause of symptoms; and (2) evidence that treatment of these abnormalities improves symptoms better than placebo.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, prognostic study.

Ulnar shortening osteotomy for ulnar-sided wrist pain.,"Background The purpose of ulnar shortening osteotomy is literally to shorten the ulna. It can tighten the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), ulnocarpal ligaments, and interosseous membrane. Nowadays, this method is used to treat ulnar-sided wrist pain, for which we have also started to use a treatment algorithm. The purpose of this study was to review the long-term and clinical results based on our algorithm. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients with ulnocarpal impaction syndrome after a minimum follow-up of 5 years (Group A) and then retrospectively evaluated 66 patients with recalcitrant ulnar wrist pain treated based on our algorithm (Group B). Description of Technique Ulnocarpal abutment was confirmed arthroscopically. The distal ulna was approached through a longitudinal incision between the extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi ulnaris. We performed a transverse resection of the ulna fixed with a small locking compression plate. The contralateral side served as the reference for the length of shortening (mean, 2.4 mm; range, 1-5 mm). Disappearance of ulnar abutment was then confirmed again arthroscopically. Results (Group A) Most patients showed good long-term clinical results. About half of the patients showed a bony spur at the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), but the clinical results did not significantly correlate with presence of bony spurs. Radiological parameters wre not related to the presence of bony spurs. (Group B) Twenty-four of the 66 patients investigated prospectively underwent an ulnar shortening osteotomy, with all showing good clinical results at 18 months postoperatively. Conclusions Ulnar shortening osteotomy can change the load of the ulnar side of the wrist and appears useful for ulnar-sided wrist pain in the presence of ulnar impaction. Level of evidence IV.

Ulnar Impaction Syndrome: Ulnar Shortening vs. Arthroscopic Wafer Procedure.,"The outcome of ulnar shortenings was compared with that of arthroscopic wafer resections for ulnar impaction (or abutment) syndrome in patients with a positive ulnar variance. The outcome was measured by DASH score, visual analog scale for pain, and working incapacity. The mean DASH score in the ulnar shortening group was 26; in the wafer group it was 36. The VAS scores were respectively 4.4 and 4.6. The working incapacity was 7?months in the ulnar shortening group and 6.1 months in the wafer group. The differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. ",Journal of wrist surgery,25032075,2014
"Distal radius fracture: diagnosis, treatment, and controversies.","This article presents the diagnosis and treatment of distal radius fractures with emphasis on (1) current common principles, (2) the author's current practices, and (3) controversies. The author emphasizes that displaced distal radius fractures should be approached first with a trial of closed reduction, with or without percutaneous pinning. If this reduction is unstable or unsuccessful, open reduction is indicated. Early treatments include percutaneous pinning through the distal radioulnar joint, early or delayed reattachment/repair of the avulsed dorsal periphery of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), reattachment of the TFCC to the ulna fovea, and late reconstruction.

Effect of wrist position on distal radioulnar joint stability: a biomechanical study.,"We investigated distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) stability in different wrist positions and examined the relative contribution of each ligamentous component of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) to DRUJ stability. We used nine fresh-frozen cadavers. The humerus and ulna were fixed at 90° elbow flexion. The radiocarpal unit was translated relative to the ulna in dorsopalmar directions with the wrist in five positions. Displacement of the unit was measured by an electromagnetic tracking device. Magnitudes of displacement were compared between different wrist positions in various sectioning stages: ulnocarpal ligament (UCL) sectioning, radioulnar ligaments (RUL) sectioning, and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) floor sectioning. Wrist position and sectioning stage significantly influenced the displacement. In intact wrists, the displacement in wrist extension was significantly lower than that in neutral. However, after UCL sectioning, there were no longer any significant differences. After RUL sectioning, the displacement in radial deviation was significantly lower than that in neutral. Following ECU floor sectioning, there were no longer any significant differences. Thus, in intact wrists, DRUJ stability in wrist extension is likely due to tightening of the UCL. After complete RUL sectioning, DRUJ is stabilized in radial deviation due to tightening of the ECU floor.",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,24965001,2014
"Assessment of T1, T1ρ, and T2 values of the ulnocarpal disc in healthy subjects at 3 tesla.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to implement clinically feasible imaging techniques for determination of T1, T1ρ, and T2 values of the ulnocarpal disc and to assess those values in a cohort of asymptomatic subjects at 3 tesla. Resulting values were compared between different age groups, since former histological findings of the ulnocarpal disc indicated frequent early degenerative changes of this tissue starting in the third decade of life, even in asymptomatic subjects.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven healthy subjects were included in this study. T1 measurements were performed using 3D spoiled gradient-echo (GRE) sequence with variable flip angle. A series of T1ρ and T2-weighted images was acquired by a 3D GRE sequence after suitable magnetization preparation. T1,T1ρ, and T2 maps of the ulnocarpal disc were calculated pixel-wise. Representative mean values from extended regions were analysed.RESULTS: Mean T1 values of the ulnocarpal disc ranged from 722 ms in a 39 year-old subject to 1264 ms in a 65 year-old subject, T1ρ ranged from 9.2 ms (26 year-old subject) to 25.9 ms (65 year-old subject). Calculated T2 values showed a large range from 4.1 ms to 22.3 ms. T1ρ and T1 values tended to increase with age (p&lt;0.05), whereas T2 did not.CONCLUSIONS: MR relaxometry of the ulnocarpal disc is feasible, and T1,T1ρ, and T2 values show modest variance in asymptomatic subjects. The potential of relaxation mapping to reveal relevant structural changes in patients has to be investigated in further studies.",Magnetic resonance imaging,24960365,2014

[Limits to arthroscopic treatment of degenerative triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions depending on the ulnar variance].,"PURPOSE: The present prospective study investigated the influence of the static ulnar variance on the success of arthroscopic debridement of degenerative TFCC lesions.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 10 patients with an ulnar positive variance (&quot;Ulna+&quot;) and 12 patients with ulnar neutral or ulnar negative variance (&quot;Ulna-/0&quot;) were examined preoperatively (U0), as well as at 2 (U2) and 6 (U6) months after arthroscopic debridement of degenerative TFCC lesions and compared with each other. After the U2 investigation due to persistent complaints in 9 of 10 patients with an ulnar positive variance there was a need for further surgery, consisting of ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO). The following parameters were recorded in each case: pain at rest and with load, the summed wrist range of motion - consisting of extension and flexion, radial and ulnar deviation, pronation and supination - compared to the contralateral side, the strength of the affected hand compared to the contralateral side, the Mayo modified wrist score (MMWS), the Krimmer score and the DASH score. Preoperatively there were no significant differences between the 2 cohorts &quot;Ulna+&quot; and &quot;Ulna-/0&quot; except for the characteristic &quot;pain at rest&quot;.RESULTS: At 2 months postoperatively (U2), the results in the cohort &quot;Ulna+&quot; remained at a significantly or tendentially poorer level compared to the cohort &quot;Ulna-/0&quot;. The subsequent surgical treatment of the subgroup &quot;Ulna+&quot; with USO led to almost complete approximation of the results at 6 months postoperatively (U6). In addition to this, with time (U6) within each subgroup there were tendential or significant improvements of all characteristics compared to the preoperative situation (U0). At U6 four of 22 patients were -unable to work.CONCLUSION: Degenerative lesions of the TFCC can be treated successfully by arthroscopic debridement in cases of ulnar negative and ulnar neutral variance. Patients with ulnar positive variance and persistent complaints after debridement of the TFCC can be treated successfully with a secondary ulnar shortening osteotomy.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",24940630,2014
[Results of arthroscopic repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex peripheral tears (Palmer type 1B)].,"BACKGROUND: Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury is the major cause of wrist pain on the ulnar side. In this study, treatment outcomes of arthroscopically repaired peripheral TFCC tears (Palmer type 1B) were evaluated retrospectively.METHODS: Thirty-eight patients (30 males, 8 females; mean age 27.6; range 19 to 42 years) with TFCC tears (Palmer type 1B) who were treated arthroscopically between February 2007-July 2012 were evaluated retrospectively. The data were collected by Mayo wrist evaluation form and by preoperative and postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS).RESULTS: The results of the data collected by the Mayo wrist evaluation forms were perfect in 30 patients and good in 8 patients. Preoperative VAS was 6.53 (range: 4.5-8.2) and postoperative VAS was 1.48 (range: 0.3-3.1).DISCUSSION: With the arthroscopic technique, TFCC tears can be repaired with minimal harm and better visualization, and evaluation of all the structures of the wrist can be done. Outside-to-inside suturing technique, which is performed through the portal opened 1 cm inferior to the 6R portal, is the least traumatic technique and does not carry the risk of injury to the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve. With this technique, the complaints of preoperative pain can be eliminated significantly.",Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma &amp; emergency surgery : TJTES,24936843,2014

The impact of coronal alignment on distal radioulnar joint stability following distal radius fracture.,"PURPOSE: Shift of the distal fragment of a distal radius fracture (DRF) in the coronal plane (coronal shift) may compromise the contributions of the distal oblique bundle (DOB) of the interosseous membrane to distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) stability. The purpose of the study was to test our hypothesis that coronal shift of the distal fragment would increase dorsal-volar DRUJ displacement in response to applied load.METHODS: A distal radius osteotomy was performed proximal to the sigmoid notch base and the ulnar styloid was cut (to simulate triangular fibrocartilage complex detachment) in 10 cadaveric specimens. A volarly placed plate was used to shift the distal radius fragment radially in 2-mm increments. A mechanical testing apparatus applied a 20 N load to the distal fragment perpendicular to the volar cortex with the forearm in neutral, 60° pronation, and 60° supination. Dorsal-volar displacement of the radius relative to the fixed ulna was measured in the control state (DRF and ulnar styloid anatomically fixed) and in 3 positions (anatomical reduction, 2-mm coronal shift, 4-mm coronal shift) with ulnar styloid displacement. The specimens were dissected post hoc to evaluate for a distinct DOB (thickness, &gt; 0.5 mm). Dorsal-volar DRUJ displacement was compared among testing and control states using analysis of variance.RESULTS: In specimens with a distinct DOB, 2-mm coronal shift significantly increased dorsal-volar DRUJ displacement. However, there was no difference in DRUJ displacement between 4-mm coronal shift and control state. Coronal shift did not affect dorsal-volar DRUJ displacement in specimens without a distinct DOB.CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of an ulnar styloid fracture, a 2-mm (but not a 4-mm) coronal shift of the DRF is associated with increased dorsal-volar DRUJ displacement in specimens with a distinct DOB, but not in specimens without a distinct DOB.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Awareness of the importance of coronal shift may aid in prevention of DRUJ instability associated with DRF, especially in patients with a DOB.",The Journal of hand surgery,24857823,2014
Sensory innervation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex: a cadaveric study.,"PURPOSE: To describe the sensory innervation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) to understand the potential for selective denervation as an alternative treatment for recalcitrant pain from stable TFCC IA lesions after failed nonsurgical treatment.METHODS: Eleven fresh cadaveric limbs were dissected with × 3.2 loupe magnification in a proximal to distal manner. The candidate nerves were the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve, volar sensory branch of the ulnar nerve, anterior interosseous nerve, posterior interosseous nerve, medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, and palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve. We identified neural continuity to the TFCC histologically with S-100 protein antibody staining.RESULTS: In the 11 specimens, the TFCC was innervated by the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve (100%), medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (91%), volar branch of the ulnar nerve (73%), anterior interosseous nerve (27%), posterior interosseous nerve (18%), and palmar branch of the median nerve (9%).CONCLUSIONS: These results provide an initial step in planning an operative partial TFCC denervation for recalcitrant TFCC IA injuries that fail nonsurgical treatment and possibly also arthroscopic debridement.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on the results of this anatomic study, it is possible to create an algorithm for performing nerve blocks of the TFCC that would aid in planning a surgical denervation procedure.",The Journal of hand surgery,24785703,2014
Current indications for and the technique of wrist arthroscopy.,"Since its introduction more than 30 years ago, wrist arthroscopy has become an essential diagnostic and therapeutic tool in hand surgery. This procedure minimizes exposures and allows access to otherwise remotely located anatomic regions with minimal morbidity. Advances in anatomic understanding and wrist scope technology have standardized the procedure and expanded indications. Current applications are diagnostic staging of various wrist pathologies where arthroscopy allows for a direct, magnified, and tactile-assisted examination. This includes injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), osteochondral lesion of the carpus, and dynamic assessment of carpal instability and radiocarpal arthritis. Therapeutic applications have continued to expand and include arthroscopic-assisted fracture reductions, treatment of radiocarpal synovitis and arthritis, TFCC repairs, and arthroscopic management of soft tissue pathologies such as ganglion excisions and release of contractures.",Orthopedics,24754550,2014
Palmar reconstruction of the triangular fibrocartilage complex for static instability of the distal radioulnar joint.,"This study describes a new technique that can be used for reconstructing the triangular fibrocartilage complex to correct the static palmar radius instability of the distal radioulnar joint. In the abovementioned condition, the radius is extremely unstable with respect to the ulna and dislocates palmarly in the resting position. Using a palmar approach, a palmaris longus tendon graft was sutured to the remnant of the disrupted palmar radioulnar and ulnocarpal ligaments and then anchored to the bone tunnel that was created at the ulnar fovea. This technique predominantly reinforces the palmar structure of triangular fibrocartilage complex because the palmar radioulnar ligament is the most critical stabilizer of palmar radius instability. ",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,24752202,2014
Anatomic foveal reconstruction of the triangular fibrocartilage complex with a tendon graft.,"An acute injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) with avulsion of the foveal attachment can produce distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability. The avulsed TFCC is translated distally so the footprint will be bathed in synovial fluid from the DRUJ and will become covered in synovitis. If the TFCC fails to heal to the footprint, then persistent instability can occur. The authors describe a surgical technique indicated for the treatment of persistent instability of the DRUJ due to foveal detachment of the TFCC. The procedure utilizes a loop of palmaris longus tendon graft passed through the ulnar aspect of the TFCC and into an osseous tunnel in the distal ulna to reconstruct the foveal attachment. This technique provides stability of the distal ulna to the radius and carpus. We recommend this procedure for chronic instability of the DRUJ due to TFCC avulsion, but recommend that suture repair remain the treatment of choice for acute instability. An arthroscopic assessment includes the trampoline test, hook test, and reverse hook test. DRUJ ballottement under arthroscopic vision details the direction of instability, the functional tear pattern, and unmasks concealed tears. If the reverse hook test demonstrates a functional instability between the TFCC and the radius, then a foveal reconstruction is contraindicated, and a reconstruction that stabilizes the radial and ulnar aspects of the TFCC is required. The foveal reconstruction technique has the advantage of providing a robust anatomically based reconstruction of the TFCC to the fovea, which stabilizes the DRUJ and the ulnocarpal sag.",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,24694387,2014
The wrist insufflation test: a confirmatory test for detecting intercarpal ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the wrist insufflation test based on mean radiocarpal and midcarpal joint space volumes.METHODS: Twenty-nine patients underwent 3-4 portal radiocarpal and radial midcarpal portal insufflation before wrist arthroscopy. The volume remaining in the radiocarpal space at equilibrium was recorded, and the contour of the dorsal wrist and distal radioulnar joint was palpated for a fluid wave. After insufflation, wrist arthroscopy was performed and diagnoses were recorded. The mean volumes of the intact radiocarpal and midcarpal spaces were then compared with those of the compromised radiocarpal and midcarpal spaces to determine the overall sensitivity and specificity of the test.RESULTS: A total of 29 patients (18 male and 11 female) underwent wrist insufflation before wrist arthroscopy. The mean age of the patients was 42 years (range, 17 to 69 years). Intact radiocarpal spaces accepted a mean of 3.5 ± 0.16 mL of fluid, whereas compromised radiocarpal spaces accepted a mean of 5.5 ± 0.48 mL of fluid (P &lt; .01; 95% confidence interval, 2.87 to 3.30). Intact midcarpal spaces accepted a mean of 2.5 ± 0.18 mL, whereas compromised midcarpal spaces accepted a mean of 5.6 ± 0.38 mL (P &lt; .01; 95% confidence interval, 1.70 to 2.30). The overall sensitivity of the test was 83.3%, and the overall specificity was 100%.CONCLUSIONS: Complete scapholunate interosseous ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex tears can be detected when there is an increased radiocarpal joint space volume with insufflation through the 3-4 portal combined with a fluid wave over the radial midcarpal space or the distal radioulnar joint. Complete scapholunate interosseous ligament and lunotriquetral interosseous ligament tears can also be detected when there is an increased midcarpal space volume with insufflation through the radial midcarpal portal combined with a fluid wave over the radial radiocarpal space or the ulnar radiocarpal space.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,24680305,2014
Ligamentous sports injuries of the hand and wrist.,"Athletic injuries of the hand and wrist continue to increase as athletes get bigger, faster, and the weekend warrior continues to be active throughout his or her lifespan. The management of hand and wrist injuries in these athletes depends on the sport, position, timing during the season the injury occurs, and how many years the athlete has left to play in competition. In the past, these injuries were thought to be trivial; but if not ideally managed, complications can occur which may keep the skilled athlete or the weekend warrior out for a prolonged period of time.

[Magnet resonance imaging in common injuries of the wrist].,"Falling on the outstretched hand is a common trauma mechanism. In contrast to fractures of the distal radius, which usually are diagnosed on plain film radiographs, identifying wrist injuries requires further diagnostic methods, e.g., MRI or CT. This article provides a review of the use of MRI in the most common traumatic wrist injuries, including scaphoid fractures, TFCC lesions, and tears of the scapholunate ligament. Early and selective use of MRI as a further diagnostic method in cases of adequate clinical suspicion helps to initiate the correct treatment and, thus, prevents long-term arthrotic injuries and reduces unnecessary absence due to illness. MRI shows a high reliability in the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures and the America College of Radiology recommends MRI as method of choice after X-ray images have been made. In the diagnosis of ligament and discoid lesions, MR arthrography (MRA) using intraarticular contrast agent has considerably higher accuracy than i.v.-enhanced and especially unenhanced MRI.",Der Unfallchirurg,24622905,2014
Ulnar shortening osteotomy utilizing a TriMed ulnar osteotomy system.,"Ulnar impaction syndrome (UIS) is a degenerative condition of the ulnar wrist typically seen in patients with static or dynamic ulnar-positive variance. Impaction of the distal ulna on the proximal lunate and triquetrum leads to degeneration of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and/or the chondral surfaces of the lunate and triquetrum. Patients with UIS present with pain in the ulnar aspect of the wrist. In cases of UIS refractory to nonoperative treatment, several surgical techniques have been described, including arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex debridement, arthroscopic wafer procedure, and ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO). USO has gained favor as a reliable technique to offload the forces seen at the ulnar wrist extra-articularly while preserving the distal radioulnar joint stabilizing structures. We describe a technique utilizing a jig-facilitated, oblique, diaphyseal USO and fixed with a TriMed ulnar osteotomy compression plate. This system allows for precise measured ulnar shortening and reliable compression across the osteotomy site, and has been shown to decrease operative times and achieve to high union rates. Plate prominence is minimized by utilizing the volar surface of the ulna, although plate prominence and subsequent need for hardware removal remain a relatively common complication.",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,24614866,2014
Distal radioulnar joint kinematics in simulated dorsally angulated distal radius fractures.,"PURPOSE: To examine the effects of dorsal angulation deformities of the distal radius with and without triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) rupture on the 3-dimensional kinematics of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) during simulated active motion.METHODS: Nine fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens were tested in a forearm simulator that produced active forearm rotation. Dorsal angulation deformities of the distal radius with 10°, 20°, and 30° angulation were created. Changes in the position of the ulna relative to the radius at the DRUJ as a consequence of each dorsal angulation deformity were quantified during simulated active supination in terms of volar, ulnar, and distal displacement of the ulna. Testing was performed initially with the TFCC intact and repeated after complete sectioning of the TFCC at its ulnar insertion.RESULTS: Increasing dorsal angulation deformities of the distal radius significantly increased volar, ulnar, and distal displacement of the ulna when the TFCC was intact. Sectioning of the TFCC significantly increased volar displacement of the ulna in dorsal angulation deformities. As little as 10° of dorsal angulation significantly increased distal displacement of the ulna with the TFCC intact and resulted in a significant increase in volar, ulnar, and distal displacement of the ulna with sectioned TFCC.CONCLUSIONS: Dorsal angulation deformities of the distal radius affect the 3-dimensional kinematics of the DRUJ, especially with the TFCC sectioned.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The progressive change in DRUJ kinematics with increasing dorsal angulation may partially explain the relationship between the magnitude of dorsal angulation of distal radius fractures and functional outcomes in younger patients. The status of the TFCC should be evaluated carefully, as well as the magnitude of osseous deformity in patients with distal radius fractures and malunions, because changes in DRUJ kinematics caused by dorsal angulation are greater when the TFCC is ruptured.",The Journal of hand surgery,24594268,2014
Arthroscopy during ulnar shortening for idiopathic ulnar impaction syndrome.,"Arthroscopy during ulnar shortening osteotomy for ulnar impaction syndrome is subject to debate regarding its clinical usefulness. The purposes of this study were to analyze the arthroscopic findings in patients who underwent ulnar shortening osteotomy and to assess the role of arthroscopic evaluation during osteotomy. Medical records and arthroscopic findings of 50 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with idiopathic ulnar impaction syndrome were retrospectively evaluated. Pathologic changes of the articular disk of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), chondromalacia of the lunate and triquetrum, and tears of the lunotriquetral interosseous ligament (LTIL) were evaluated during arthroscopy. Palmer’s classification was used to classify the TFCC lesions. Perforation of the TFCC was observed in 20 patients, and central tears were observed in 10. Thirty-eight patients exhibited chondromalacia of the lunate, including 4 unstable cartilage flaps. Partial tears of the LTIL were detected in 24 patients, including 9 unstable flap tears. In 21 (42%) of 50 patients, arthroscopic findings were not appropriate to define the disease stage with Palmer’s original description. Eight wrists exhibited tears or perforations of the TFCC without evidence of chondromalacia. Seven patients had an LTIL tear without perforation of the TFCC. Lunotriquetral interosseous ligament tears without lunate chondromalacia were found in 7 patients. Arthroscopic debridement was performed in 23 patients based on the clinical judgment that the procedure would help alleviate symptoms postoperatively. Arthroscopy during ulnar shortening osteotomy addresses intra-articular pathologies and may be helpful for symptom improvement.",Orthopedics,24579220,2014
[Instability of the distal radioulnar joint - an overview of clinical and radiological procedures regarding their efficacies].,"The distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) plays a tremendous role regarding the functionality of the upper extremity. Lesions of the DRUJ can limit the functionality of the upper extremity decisively. Many clinical and radiological procedures are used to diagnose instability of the DRUJ. Up to now, there has not been a general consensus concerning the standardisation of the evaluation of DRUJ instability. The TFCC (triangular fibrocartilage complex) with its ligamentum subcruentum insertions at the fovea ulnaris and at the basis of the processus styloideus ulnae is in conjunction with the membrana interossea a very important stabiliser of the DRUJ. A fall on the extended hand or a forceful wrist rotation can usually cause injuries to the stabilisers. Ulnar-sided pain, limited pronosupination and loss of grip strength are clinically apparent. Both clinical tests and radiological procedures should be judged regarding their specific efficacies. These tests have to be evaluated in comparison to the gold standard of wrist arthroscopy. Each test alone is not able to verify DRUJ instability on a regular basis. The introduction of a standardised diagnostic procedure including anamnesis and specific clinical and radiological tests should be established. The standardisation ought to be maintained strictly in order to guarantee a growing test efficacy. Finally, high diagnostic reliability is based on a thorough examination which includes complementary clinical and radiological procedures.

Revision wrist arthroscopy after failed primary arthroscopic treatment.,"Background The etiologies and outcomes of cases of failed therapeutic wrist arthroscopy have not been well-described to date. Purpose The purposes of this study were to identify common preventable patterns of failure in wrist arthroscopy and to report outcomes of a series of revision arthroscopy cases. Patients and Methods Retrospective review of 237 wrist arthroscopies revealed 21 patients with a prior arthroscopy for the same symptoms, of which 16 were assessed by questionnaires and physical exam for this study. Results Six of sixteen patients (38%) had unrecognized dynamic ulnar impaction after débridement of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears, which resolved with arthroscopic wafer resection. Five (31%) had persistent distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability after initial treatment of TFCC tears, requiring arthroscopic repair at revision. Four (25%) experienced diffuse dorsal wrist pain initially diagnosed as TFCC tears, but dynamic scapholunate ligament injuries were found and addressed with radiofrequency (RF) shrinkage at reoperation. Two (13%) required further resection of the radial styloid, after initial débridement was insufficient to correct radioscaphoid impingement. At a mean of 4.8 years after repeat arthroscopy (range, 1.5-13.4 years), this cohort had significant improvements in pain and satisfaction with outcomes after revision arthroscopy. Conclusions The most common indications for repeat wrist arthroscopy were ligamentous instability (of the DRUJ or scapholunate ligament) and osteoarthritis (from dynamic ulnar impaction or radioscaphoid impingement). Although revision wrist arthroscopy may yield acceptable outcomes, careful assessment of stability and cartilage wear at index procedure is crucial.</AbstractText>: Background The etiologies and outcomes of cases of failed therapeutic wrist arthroscopy have not been well-described to date.

Defining residual radial translation of distal radius fractures: a potential cause of distal radioulnar joint instability.,"BACKGROUND: Instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is a complication that can occur following distal radius fracture or malunion. We have observed that residual radial translation of the distal radius, relative to the radial shaft, may be a causal factor of DRUJ instability, even once the traditional radiographic parameters (volar tilt, radial inclination, and ulnar variance) have been restored. Residual radial translation of the distal fragment may cause detensioning of the distal interosseous membrane (IOM) and pronator quadratus with poor apposition between the ulnar head and sigmoid notch. This may potentially lead to persistent instability of the ulnar head following internal fixation. Residual radial translation deformity is at risk of being overlooked by the wrist surgeon as there is no existing radiographic parameter that accurately measures this deformity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 100 normal wrist radiographs were reviewed by three fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons to develop a simple and reproducible technique to measure radial translation.RESULTS: Utilizing the method described, the point of intersection between the ulnar cortex of the shaft of the radius and the lunate left a mean average of 45.48% (range 25–73.68%) of the lunate remaining on the radial side. In the majority of cases more of the lunate resided ulnar to this line. High levels of agreement with inter-rater (intraclass coefficients = 0.967) and intra-rater (intraclass coefficients = 0.79) reliability was observed.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study can be used to define a normal standard against which residual radial translation can be measured to assess the reduction of distal radius fractures. This new parameter aids in the development of surgical techniques to correct residual radial translation deformity. In addition, awareness and correction of this potential malreduction at the time of surgery may decrease the need for other procedures on the ulnar side of the wrist to improve DRUJ stability, such as ulnar styloid fixation, TFCC repair, or ligamentous grafting [corrected].",Journal of wrist surgery,24533242,2014
Influence of ulnar translation of the radial shaft in distal radius fracture on distal radioulnar joint instability.,"It has been reported that the distal interosseous membrane (DIOM) of the forearm constrains the dorsal dislocation of the distal radius. A residual ulnar translation deformity of the radial shaft in distal radius fractures has the potential to cause distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability when triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury is also present, because it may result in detensioning of the DIOM. Correction of ulnar translation of the radial shaft is critical because it restores DIOM tension, which then firmly holds the ulnar head in the concavity of the sigmoid notch.

Radiographic and Arthroscopic Assessment of DRUJ Instability Due to Foveal Avulsion of the Radioulnar Ligament in Distal Radius Fractures.,"Background As the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) anchors the distal radius to the ulna via the radioulnar ligament (RUL), a severely displaced distal fragment of the radius may be associated with a foveal avulsion of the TFCC. The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess, radiographically and arthroscopically, the relationship between displacement of the radius, the ulnar styloid, and avulsion of the RUL resulting in distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability. Materials and Methods Twenty-nine wrists of 29 patients with intra- and extra-articular distal radius fractures/malunion who underwent reduction or a corrective osteotomy of the displaced/malunited fracture, and/or wrist arthroscopy, were assessed radiographically and arthroscopically. Radial translation, radial inclination, radial shortening, volar or dorsal tilt, and the presence of an ulnar styloid fracture with more than 4 mm of displacement were measured from the initial films. Radiocarpal arthroscopy was used to assess peripheral lesions of the TFCC, while DRUJ arthroscopy was used to assess the foveal attachment. The relationship between displacement of the distal radius or the ulnar styloid fracture and the TFCC injury, including avulsion of the RUL, was recorded. Results Univariate analysis revealed that increased radial translation, decreased radial inclination, increased radial shortening, and an ulnar styloid fragment radially displaced by more than 4 mm were significant predictors of RUL avulsion at the fovea. Volar or dorsal tilt of the radius and ulnar variance did not correlate with RUL avulsion or TFCC injuries. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that radial translation was an independent risk factor of foveal avulsion of the RUL. Conclusions Increased radial translation and radial shortening and decreased radial inclination of the distal fragment can be associated with a foveal avulsion of the RUL. Radial translation can be an independent risk factor of foveal avulsion of the RUL. ",Journal of wrist surgery,24533240,2014
Avascular necrosis of the lunate bone (Kienböck's disease) secondary to scapholunate ligament tear as a consequence of trauma - a case study.,"BACKGROUND: Avascular necrosis of the lunate bone (Kienböck's disease), is a condition in which lunate bone, loses its blood supply, leading to necrosis of the bone. There is probably no single cause of Kienbock's disease. Its origin may involve multiple factors, such as the blood supply (arteries), blood drainage (veins), and skeletal variations. Trauma, either isolated or repeated, may possibly be a factor in some cases. This case presented with multifactorial etiology.CASE REPORT: In the presented case, a patient with negative ulnar variant had injured her right wrist and presented at an orthopedic clinic due to nonspecific pain 6 months later. An arthro-MRI examination revealed necrosis of the lunate bone, scapholunate ligament tear and coexisting TFCC (triangular fibrocartilage complex) tear.CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent progression of necrotic lesions and bone collapse. MRI examination seems to be the key diagnostic method in the early stage of the Kienböck's disease with negative x-ray and CT images. Arthro-MRI examination also allows us to identify the underlying ligamentous injury. In cases of traumatic etiology, an additional CT test enables stating the final diagnosis.",Polish journal of radiology,24523832,2014
A Newer Technique of Distal Ulna Reconstruction Using Proximal Fibula and TFCC Reconstruction Using Palmaris Longus Tendon following Wide Resection of Giant Cell Tumour of Distal Ulna.,"Giant cell tumour of the bone (GCT) is a rare locally aggressive primary bone tumour with an incidence of 3% to 5% of all primary bone tumours. The most common location for this tumour is the long bone metaepiphysis especially of the distal femur, proximal tibia, distal radius, and the proximal humerus. Involvement of distal ulna is rare accounting for 0.45% to 3.2%. Considering local aggressive nature and high recurrence, wide resection is the treatment recommended. Instability of ulnar stump and ulnar translation of the carpals are known complications following resection of distal ulna. To overcome these problems, we attempted a newer technique of distal ulna reconstruction using proximal fibula and TFCC reconstruction using palmaris longus tendon following wide resection of giant cell tumour of distal ulna in a 44-year-old male. This technique of distal radioulnar joint reconstruction has excellent functional results with no evidence of recurrence after one-year followup. ",Case reports in orthopedics,24455371,2014
Distal oblique bundle reconstruction and distal radioulnar joint instability.,"Background This study created an anatomic reconstruction of the distal oblique bundle (DOB) of the interosseous membrane to determine its effect on distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability and compare this technique with distal radioulnar ligament (DRUL) reconstruction. Questions/Purposes We hypothesized that this reconstruction would provide equivalent stability to DRUL reconstruction and that combining the two techniques would enhance stability. Methods Six cadaveric upper limbs were affixed to a custom frame. The volar/dorsal translation of the radius relative to the ulna was measured in 60° pronation, neutral, and 60° supination. Translation was sequentially measured with the DRUJ intact, with sectioned DRULs and triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC), and with sectioned DOBs. Reconstructions were performed on the DRULs, on the DOB tensioned in both neutral and supination, and employing both techniques. Results The DOB reconstruction, tensioned both in the neutral position and in 60° supination, was more stable than the partial and complete instability in 6/6 specimens in pronation and the neutral position and in 5/6 specimens in supination. The DOB reconstruction and the DOB reconstruction tensioned in supination were more stable than the DRUL reconstruction in 4/6 patients. Combining the two techniques did not further reduce translation. Conclusions The DOB reconstruction is capable of improving stability in the unstable DRUJ. ",Journal of wrist surgery,24436838,2014
Causes of a block to forearm rotation after distal radius fractures.,Three cases of a block to forearm rotation after a distal radius fracture were presented.

Dorsal capsuloplasty for dorsal instability of the distal ulna.,"Background Dorsal instability of the distal ulna can lead to chronic wrist pain and loss of function. Structural changes to the dorsal radioulnar ligaments (DRUL) of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and the dorsal capsule around the ulnar head with or without foveal detachment can lead to volar subluxation of the distal radius e.g., dorsal instability of the distal ulna. Purpose Is to evaluate the post-operative results of reinstituting distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) stability through reefing of the dorsal capsule and dorsal radioulnar ligaments, with and without a foveal reattachment of the TFCC. Methods A total of 37 patients were included in this retrospective study. Diagnosis and treatment was based strictly on dry wrist arthroscopy. In 17 patients isolated reefing of the DRUL and their collateral tissue extension was performed. In 20 patients an additional foveal reinsertion was performed. Postoperative results were evaluated with the DASH questionnaire, VAS scores, grip strength and range of motion. These findings were extrapolated in the Mayo wrist score. The two subgroups were compared. Results Mayo wrist scores of the whole population had a mean of 73. There was no difference between the group that was treated with reefing of the DRUL only and the group that was treated with a combined foveal reinsertion. Conclusion This relatively simple 'dorsal reefing' procedure, with foveal reinsertion when indicated, is a reliable method to restore volar-dorsal DRUJ stability with a significant decrease in pain sensation, good DASH scores and restoration of functional grip strength and ROM.

Dorsal wrist capsular tears in association with scapholunate instability: results of an arthroscopic dorsal capsuloplasty.,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to report the association of dorsal wrist capsular avulsion with scapholunate ligament instability and to evaluate the results of an arthroscopy-assisted repair. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients with a mean age of 39.1 years suffering from chronic dorsal wrist pain. They underwent a wrist arthroscopy with an evaluation of the scapholunate ligament complex from the radiocarpal and midcarpal compartments. An avulsion of the dorsal intercarpal ligament (DICL) from the scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) was visible from the radiocarpal compartment in all cases, while the SLIL was intact. The DICL tear was repaired with an arthroscopy-assisted dorsal capsuloplasty. Patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively by the QuickDASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) questionnaire, by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, and by a clinical and radiological examination. Results Preoperatively, all patients had reduced flexion and radial deviation of the affected wrist. On the lateral radiograph, 5 of the 10 patients showed an increase of the scapholunate angle (60 to 85°). The scapholunate instability was graded as Messina-European Wrist Arthroscopy Society (EWAS) II in five cases and as grade IIIB in five cases. A tear of the ulnar part of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was found in seven cases. At a mean followup of 16 months, the wrist range of motion (ROM), the grip strength, the QuickDASH, and the VAS of pain improved significatively. The scapholunate angle was normalized in all cases. Discussion Isolated tears of the DICL at its insertion from the dorsal part of the SLIL can be associated with scapholunate instability in the absence of an injury to the SLIL. The diagnosis is made arthroscopically. The arthroscopic dorsal capsuloplasty is a minimally invasive technique that provides short-term satisfactory results. Further studies are needed to determine whether repair of the DICL tear could prevent secondary destabilization of the scapholunate ligament complex. Level of evidence IV (case series) Diagnosis.

Distal ulna fractures.,"In isolation, distal ulna fractures are rare. They are often found in conjunction with distal radius fractures, and the complexity of the interaction of the distal ulna with the radioulnar joint and triangular fibrocartilage complex makes understanding and treatment of distal ulna fractures challenging. Fixation of distal ulna fractures can be problematic owing to comminution making reduction challenging. A thin soft tissue can lead to hardware prominence and necessitate implant removal. In this Current Concepts article, we review the anatomy, pathology, and treatment of distal ulna fractures as well as potential complications and salvage procedures.

Distal radio-ulnar joint instability in children and adolescents after wrist trauma.,"This study retrospectively evaluated the medical records and radiographs of patients younger than aged 25 that were referred for a second opinion due to ulnar-sided wrist pain and persistent distal radio-ulnar (DRU) joint instability. We identified 85 patients with a major wrist trauma before the age of 18. Median age at trauma was 14 years. Median time between trauma and diagnosis of DRUJ instability was 3 years. Sixty-seven patients (79%) had sustained a fracture at the initial trauma. The two most common skeletal injuries related to the DRUJ instability were Salter-Harris type II fractures (24%) and distal radius fractures (19%). In 19 patients (22%), the secondary DRUJ instability was caused by malunion or growth arrest. Eighteen patients (21%) had no fracture; in spite of this, they presented with subsequent symptomatic DRUJ instability. Fourteen of these 18 patients had a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear, confirmed by arthroscopy, open surgery, or magnetic resonance imaging. In conclusion, late DRUJ instability due to wrist fractures or isolated TFCC tears was found to be common in children and adolescents.</AbstractText>: This study retrospectively evaluated the medical records and radiographs of patients younger than aged 25 that were referred for a second opinion due to ulnar-sided wrist pain and persistent distal radio-ulnar (DRU) joint instability.

Effect of untreated triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears on the clinical outcome of conservatively treated distal radius fractures.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of untreated triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear on the clinical outcome of conservatively treated distal radius fractures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study comprised 47 consecutive patients who presented at our clinic between January 2009 and January 2010 with displaced radius distal fracture and were treated with closed reduction and casting. During the first 15 days of treatment, all patients underwent wrist MR imaging to detect traumatic TFCC tears. At the final follow-up, all patients were evaluated with Mayo wrist function score and wrist radiographs. Patients were divided into two groups according to presence of TFCC tear, and two groups were analyzed statistically.RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 38.9 ± 3.5 months (range 36-48). TFCC tear was detected in 24 cases, and remaining 23 cases had no TFCC tear. Both groups were statistically similar regarding age (p = 0.574), gender (p = 0.108), dominant side involvement (p = 0.339), fracture type (p = 0.709) and immobilization period (p = 0.514). According to Mayo wrist score, excellent results were obtained in 21 (44.7%) cases, good in 16 (34.0%) and satisfactory in 10 (21.3%). No significant difference was observed between groups in wrist function scores (p = 0.451). Radiographic measurements were similar between groups (radial length p = 0.835, volar til p = 0.464, radial inclination p = 0.795).CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic TFCC tears which are frequently seen together with distal radius fractures do not affect the long-term functional results. Therefore, further diagnostic tests and treatment of TFCC tears in patients with stable distal radius fractures may be unnecessary. However, it should be borne in mind as a reason for continuing wrist pain and instability after distal radius fractures despite proper radiologic recovery.",European journal of orthopaedic surgery &amp; traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,24318212,2013
Simple debridement has little useful value on the clinical course of recalcitrant ulnar wrist pain.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate treatment results following arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) debridement for recalcitrant ulnar wrist pain. According to the treatment algorithm, 66 patients (36 men and 30 women with a mean age of 38.1 years (15 to 67)) with recalcitrant ulnar wrist pain were allocated to undergo ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO; n = 24), arthroscopic TFCC repair (n = 15), arthroscopic TFCC debridement (n = 14) or prolonged conservative treatment (n = 13). The mean follow-up was 36.0 months (15 to 54). Significant differences in Hand20 score at 18 months were evident between the USO group and TFCC debridement group (p = 0.003), and between the TFCC repair group and TFCC debridement group (p = 0.029). Within-group comparisons showed that Hand20 score at five months or later and pain score at two months or later were significantly decreased in the USO/TFCC repair groups. In contrast, scores in the TFCC debridement/conservative groups did not decrease significantly. Grip strength at 18 months was significantly improved in the USO/TFCC repair groups, but not in the TFCC debridement/conservative groups. TFCC debridement shows little benefit on the clinical course of recalcitrant ulnar wrist pain even after excluding patients with ulnocarpal abutment or TFCC detachment from the fovea from the indications for arthroscopic TFCC debridement.",The bone &amp; joint journal,24293601,2013

Comparison between high-resolution isotropic three-dimensional and high-resolution conventional two-dimensional FSE MR images of the wrist at 3 tesla: a pilot study.,"PURPOSE: To demonstrate the clinical feasibility of high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) isotropic FSE MRI of the wrist by comparing it to high-resolution conventional 2D FSE (2D) MRI.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven healthy volunteers were enrolled. All images were obtained at 3 Tesla (T). Delineation of anatomic structures of the wrist, amount of artifact, quality of fat suppression, image blur, and overall quality were qualitatively evaluated. Relative signal intensity (SI) of each structure and relative signal contrast between structures of the wrist were quantitatively measured.RESULTS: The 2D MRI demonstrated significantly higher scores than 3D in anatomic delineation of the SL ligament (P = 0.013), fat suppression (P = 0.013), and image blur (P = 0.003). The remaining quantitative analyses, including overall quality, revealed no statistical significances between 2D and 3D MRI. There were no statistical differences in relative SI of each structure between 2D and 3D imaging, except for bone marrow with fat suppression. There were no significant differences in relative fluid to TFCC and fluid to bone marrow contrast between 2D and 3D imaging, suggesting that both sequences have similar rates of detection for TFCC pathology and bone marrow lesions.CONCLUSION: With regard to clinical applications, 3D MRI of the wrist has almost equal potential to 2D MRI.",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,24227687,2013
Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of triangular fibrocartilage complex foveal avulsion in the ulnar variance-positive patient.,"PURPOSE: Our aim was to evaluate the clinical results of patients treated by arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of foveal avulsion injury of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) using a suture anchor.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the results of 15 patients (11 men and 4 women; mean age, 30.5 years) who underwent surgical procedures for the treatment of TFCC foveal avulsion at our hospital. The patients were followed up for a mean of 29 months. The patients had TFCC foveal avulsion caused by sprains (n = 8), falls (n = 4), playing baseball (n = 2), and a motor vehicle accident (n = 1). All the patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Radiographs obtained to assess ulnar variance (UV), ulnar-dorsal subluxation, and function of the wrist based on grip power; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; and Mayo wrist score were examined for all patients both preoperatively and postoperatively.RESULTS: On preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, TFCC foveal avulsion was observed in 13 of 15 cases. The mean UV value based on preoperative simple radiographic findings was 1.7 ± 1.0 mm, and dorsal subluxation at the distal ulna improved from 2.9 ± 3.0 mm to 0.2 ± 0.9 mm (P = .017). In all cases the distal radioulnar joint instability disappeared postoperatively. Grip power (compared with the uninvolved limb) was 79.3% preoperatively and 82.9% postoperatively (P = .086). The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores were 28.4 points preoperatively and 16.6 points postoperatively (P = .061). The Mayo wrist scores were excellent in 10 cases, good in 2, and fair in 3, and the mean score improved significantly from 64 points preoperatively to 84 points postoperatively (P = .007).CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic-assisted suture anchor reattachment of the TFCC in patients with traumatic TFCC foveal avulsion can prevent or reduce distal radioulnar joint instability and reduce pain even in chronic cases with positive UV.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,24209673,2013
Arthroscopic repair of triangular fibrocartilage tears: a biomechanical comparison of a knotless suture anchor and the traditional outside-in repairs.,"PURPOSE: To compare the biomechanical strength of a knotless suture anchor repair and the traditional outside-in repair of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears in a cadaveric model.METHODS: We dissected the distal ulna and TFCC from 6 matched cadaveric wrist pairs and made iatrogenic complete peripheral TFCC tears in each wrist. In 6 wrists, the TFCC tears were repaired using the standard outside-in technique using 2 2-0 polydioxane sutures placed in a vertical mattress fashion. In the other 6 wrists, we repaired the TFCC tears using mini-pushlock suture anchors to the fovea. The strength of the repairs was then determined using a materials testing machine with the load placed across the repair site. We loaded the repairs until a gap of 2 mm formed across the repair site, and then subsequently loaded them to failure. Thus, for each repair we obtained the load at 2-mm gap formation, load to failure, and mode of failure.RESULTS: At the 2-mm gap formation, the suture anchor repairs were statistically stronger than the outside-in repairs. For load to failure, the suture anchor repairs were also statistically stronger than the outside-in repairs. Failure in both techniques occurred most commonly as suture pull-out from the soft tissues.CONCLUSIONS: The all-arthroscopic suture anchor TFCC repair was biomechanically stronger than an outside-in repair.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The suture anchor technique allows for repair of both the superficial and deep layers of the articular disk directly to bone, restoring the native TFCC anatomy. By being knotless, the suture anchor repair avoids irritation to the surrounding soft tissues by suture knots.",The Journal of hand surgery,24206982,2013
Diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging for common articular wrist pathology.,"The authors retrospectively compared the diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging for intra-articular wrist pathology (triangular fibrocartilage complex, lunotriquetral and scapholunate injuries), using wrist arthroscopy as the gold standard. Sixty-six patients had clinical examination and arthroscopy; 38 of them also had magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination for all three injuries combined was 56.1%, and the accuracy of MRI was 55.3%. Magnetic resonance imaging was more specific, while clinical examination was more sensitive. Clinical examination was more accurate for specific triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries, while magnetic resonance imaging was more accurate for lunotriquetral (LT) and scapholunate (SL) ligament injuries. The study results suggest that magnetic resonance imaging has a use where clinical examination is ambiguous or where scapholunate damage is suspected.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,24205765,2013
A novel technique for detecting instability of the distal radioulnar joint in complete triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions.,"We performed this study to investigate whether discrepancy of bilateral dorsovolar shift of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is decisive for the diagnosis of DRUJ instability. Although several cadaver studies have quantified the amount of physiological dorsovolar shift, so far, there is no reliable method of quantification of DRUJ mobility in daily practice. The aim was to describe a novel sonographic method of quantifying DRUJ instability and evaluate its reliability and validity. In this study, 40 healthy volunteers and 17 patients with complete rupture of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) underwent sonographic quantification of the grade of instability of their DRUJ bilaterally. Dorsovolar ulnar head translation relative to the distal radius was quantified by means of ultrasonography performed in a transversal plane through the ulnar head and Lister tubercle. Measurements were done while actively pressing the volar surface of the hand onto a brick 30 degrees pronated, and after lifting the hand. A quotient Q of the radioulnar distance (distance between the dorsal radius surface and the ulnar head) between the unloaded and loaded wrist was calculated for differentiation of a normal and unstable DRUJ. The Q ratio of the 17 patients with unilateral TFCC lesion was significantly different between the pathologic side and the contralateral wrist (1.19 vs. 0.54, p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in the Q ratio in the 40 healthy volunteers between the right and left side or dominant and nondominant wrist. A Q ratio &gt; 0.8 was found to be a reasonable cut-off for pathologic laxity of the DRUJ with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 81%. A quotient Q &gt; 0.8 determines instability of the DRUJ reliably. This was a level II diagnostic study. ",Journal of wrist surgery,24179720,2013
Wrist Arthroscopy under Portal Site Local Anesthesia (PSLA) without Tourniquet.,"Purpose wrist arthroscopy is typically performed under general or regional anesthesia with the aid of a tourniquet to maintain a bloodless field. We have been using portal site local anesthesia (PSLA) for wrist arthroscopy without a tourniquet since 1998. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and complications of PSLA and whether this can be recommended for routine wrist arthroscopy. Method We conducted a retrospective study, identifying 111 consecutive cases of wrist arthroscopies performed from January 2007 to December 2009. All cases were performed under PSLA. The effectiveness of PSLA was assessed by analyzing whether the procedure required adjuvant forms of anesthesia. The subjective effectiveness was assessed via phone questionnaires. Results Sixty-eight male and 43 female patients were identified. The average age was 43.2 (range 16-77). The indications included chronic wrist pain of unknown origin (30), posttraumatic arthritis (27), rheumatoid arthritis (5), ganglion (30), triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury (14), infectious (1), and carpal instability (4). The average duration of the procedures was 73 minutes (range 20-255 minutes). Therapeutic procedures were performed in all 111 cases in addition to a routine diagnostic assessment. These included arthroscopic debridement (82) synovectomy (6), ganglionectomy (30), TFCC repair (3), TFCC debridement (11), radial styloidectomy (2), wafer procedure (4), thermal shrinkage (2), distal scaphoidectomy (1), and synovial biopsy (4). All procedures could be completed uneventfully. Most patients tolerated the procedure well throughout the operation, and the satisfaction level was high. No complication was encountered. Discussions We concluded that PSLA technique is a feasible mode of anesthesia in selected patients.</AbstractText>: Purpose wrist arthroscopy is typically performed under general or regional anesthesia with the aid of a tourniquet to maintain a bloodless field.

Feasibility and preliminary results of SPECT/CT arthrography of the wrist in comparison with MR arthrography in patients with suspected ulnocarpal impaction.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and performance of SPECT/CT arthrography of the wrist in comparison with MR arthrography in patients with suspected ulnocarpal impaction.METHODS: This prospective study included 28 wrists of 27 patients evaluated with SPECT/CT arthrography and MR arthrography. Iodine contrast medium and gadolinium were injected into the distal radioulnar and midcarpal joints. Late-phase SPECT/CT was performed 3.5 h after intravenous injection of approximately 650 MBq (99m)Tc-DPD. MR and SPECT/CT images were separately reviewed in relation to bone marrow oedema, radionuclide uptake, and tears in the scapholunate (SL) and lunotriquetral (LT) ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), and an overall diagnosis of ulnar impaction. MR, CT and SPECT/CT imaging findings were compared with each other, with the surgical findings in 12 patients and with clinical follow-up.RESULTS: The quality of MR arthrography and SPECT/CT arthrography images was fully diagnostic in 23 of 28 wrists (82%) and 25 of 28 wrists (89%), respectively. SPECT/CT arthrography was not diagnostic for ligament lesions due to insufficient intraarticular contrast in one wrist. MR and SPECT/CT images showed concordant findings regarding TFCC lesions in 22 of 27 wrists (81%), SL ligament in 22 of 27 wrists (81%) and LT ligament in 23 of 27 wrists (85%). Bone marrow oedema on MR images and scintigraphic uptake were concordant in 21 of 28 wrists (75%). MR images showed partial TFCC defects in four patients with normal SPECT/CT images. MR images showed bone marrow oedema in 4 of 28 wrists (14%) without scintigraphic uptake, and scintigraphic uptake was present without MR bone marrow oedema in three wrists (11%). Regarding diagnosis of ulnar impaction the concordance rate between CT and SPECT/CT was 100% and reached 96% (27 of 28) between MR and SPECT/CT arthrography. The sensitivity and specificity of MR, CT and SPECT/CT arthrography were 93%, 100% and 100%, and 93%, 93% and 93%, respectively.CONCLUSION: SPECT/CT arthrography of the wrist is feasible. Regarding diagnosis of ulnar impaction we found a high concordance with MR arthrography. SPECT/CT arthrography of the wrist is an alternative to MR arthrography in patients with contraindications to MR imaging.",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,24177809,2013
An anomalous bifid distal ulna: A case report.,"INTRODUCTION: We report a case of an osteochondroma in the form of an anomalous bifid distal ulna following mal-union of an epiphyseal injury. There has been no previous case of this reported in the medical literature.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 19-year-old man presented with wrist stiffness and complete loss of pronation and supination twelve months after having undergone open reduction and internal fixation for a volarly displaced distal radius fracture. Further investigation with a CT scan showed a bifid distal ulna. As this was not present on plain radiographs one year prior, it was proposed that this was an osteochrondromatous growth caused by injury to the distal ulnar epiphysis. An operation was performed to excise one of the distal ulna heads, and reconstruct the TFCC to allow improved rotational movements. At one year follow-up, the patient has made an almost full recovery without complication.DISCUSSION: We postulate that the patient sustained an occult physeal injury resulting in an osteochondromatous lesion that grew towards the joint effectively forming a second ulna head.CONCLUSION: This is a unique case of the development of a bifid distal ulna due to physeal injury one year prior. Such a lesion has not previously been described in the distal ulna.",International journal of surgery case reports,24055912,2013
Analysis of soft tissue injuries associated with distal radius fractures.,"BACKGROUND: Soft tissue injuries associated with distal radius fractures have been reported by some authors. Arthroscopy can be used to evaluate the condition of the articular surface and intracarpal soft tissues and as an aid to treatment. There are three intracarpal soft tissues of particular importance: the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), the scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL), and the lunotriquetral interosseous ligament (LTIL). The purpose of this study was to evaluate intracarpal soft tissue injuries and their relationships with fracture types during arthroscopic surgical treatment of distal radius fractures.METHODS: Eighty-nine patients in our hospital underwent surgical treatment by arthroscopy for a fracture of the distal end of the radius. They ranged in age from 17 to 92 years (mean, 62.2 years), and comprised 20 men (mean age, 45.6 years) and 69 women (mean age, 66.5 years). The AO classification data on plain radiographs indicated A2 fracture in four patients, A3 fracture in 10 patients, C1 fracture in two patients, C2 fracture in 24 patients, and C3 fracture in 49 patients. Wrist arthroscopy was performed with vertical traction, and intracarpal soft tissues were examined. For assessment of the TFCC in the radiocarpal space, the Palmar classification was used. For assessment of the SLIL and LTIL in the midcarpal space, the Geissler classification was used.RESULTS: TFCC injury was present in 59% of cases, SLIL injury in 54.5% of cases, and LTIL injury in 34.5% of cases. Only 17.1% of patients (14/82 patients) were negative for all three types of injury. In 81% of cases (72/89 patients), some intracarpal soft tissue injury was present in association with the fracture.CONCLUSIONS: The fracture was complicated by TFCC injury in 59% of patients, SLIL injury in 54.5% of patients, and LTIL injury in 34.5% of patients, irrespective of the fracture type.","BMC sports science, medicine &amp; rehabilitation",24004506,2013
Comparison between open and arthroscopic-assisted foveal triangular fibrocartilage complex repair for post-traumatic distal radio-ulnar joint instability.,"The aim of this study was to assess the objective and subjective functional outcomes after foveal reattachment of proximal or complete ulnar-sided triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions by two surgical procedures: an open technique or an arthroscopically assisted repair. The study was done prospectively on 49 wrists affected by post-traumatic distal radio-ulnar joint instability. Twenty-four patients were treated with the open technique (Group 1) and 25 by the arthroscopically assisted technique (Group 2). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a clear foveal detachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex in 67% of the cases. Arthroscopy showed a positive ulnar-sided detachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (positive hook test) in all cases. Distal radio-ulnar joint stability was obtained in all but five patients at a mean follow-up of 6 months. Both groups had improvement of all parameters with significant differences in wrist pain scores, Mayo wrist score, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire and Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation questionnaire scores. There were no significant post-operative differences between the two groups in the outcome parameters except for the Disability of the Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire score, which was significantly better in Group 2 (p &lt; 0.001).

Utility of magnetic resonance imaging for detection of longitudinal split tear of the ulnotriquetral ligament.,"PURPOSE: Wrist magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has established utility in the diagnosis of wrist ligament tears, including complete tears of the ulnotriquetral ligament (UTL) and other components of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. A new type of longitudinal split tear of the UTL has recently been described with no imaging correlate. Our aims were to describe putative MRI findings associated with longitudinal UTL split tears and to assess diagnostic accuracy.METHODS: We randomly selected 40 patients with arthroscopically proven longitudinal UTL split tears and 20 patients with intact UTLs, all of whom had preoperative 3 T MRI of the same wrist performed, from a list of operative notes spanning from January 1997 through October 2011, filtered with the terms &quot;ulnotriquetral ligament&quot; and &quot;ulnar triquetral ligament.&quot; Two musculoskeletal radiologists who were blinded to surgical results and clinical information independently reviewed the exams. They recorded the degree of certainty of whether a longitudinal UTL split tear was present and whether several other hypothesized associated abnormalities were present.RESULTS: Overall sensitivity for definitive longitudinal UTL split tear detection on MRI was 58% for reader 1 and 30% for reader 2. Specificity was 60% for both. There were no statistically significant discriminatory findings.CONCLUSIONS: Among a selected group of patients who all had wrist arthroscopy, preoperative noncontrast 3 T wrist MRI had poor sensitivity and specificity for detection of the longitudinal split type of UTL tear. To date, MRI may be more helpful to exclude potential alternative diagnoses in the patient with ulnar wrist pain.",The Journal of hand surgery,23910380,2013
TILT Following a TFCC Tear: A Case Report.,"We describe the case of a dorsal proximal triquetral impingement caused by a torn triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) amassed on the repair site at the ulnar styloid. The impinging tissue was removed by simple burring with resultant relief of symptoms. This case illustrates painful impingement of soft tissue on the triquetrum. Possibly, the source of tissue impingement may include different extra-articular or torn intra-articular structures. Soft tissue impingement on the triquetrum may be a cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain following failed TFCC repair. ",Journal of wrist surgery,23904982,2013
Wide-Awake Wrist Arthroscopy and Open TFCC Repair.,"The wide-awake approach to hand surgery entails the use of local infiltration anesthesia using lidocaine with epinephrine and no tourniquet. The technique provides practitioners with an option to perform advanced hand surgical care in an ambulatory setting, without the need for general or regional anesthetics. We present our results using wide-awake approach in wrist surgery, both open and arthroscopic. Between June and August 2011, the wide-awake approach was used in nine elective wrist surgery cases; three arthroscopic procedures, four open triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) repairs, and two combined arthroscopy/open surgery (eight men/one woman). The arthroscopic patients were anesthetized using dorsal infiltration of lidocaine with epinephrine (20 mL) with an additional intra-articular 5 mL injection 30 minutes before surgery. The open surgery patients received 40 mL of lidocaine with epinephrine around the ulnar aspect of the forearm, from 8-cm proximal to 3-cm distal to the distal radioulnar joint. Standard diagnostic radio- and midcarpal arthroscopies were performed, where one patient had a loose body removed and two patients underwent TFCC debridements due to central TFCC tears. The six open cases were all due to TFCC foveal disruptions, which were reinserted using osteosutures in the distal ulna. Following placement of the ligament sutures, a preliminary knot allowed active and passive motion testing of pronosupination, to determine the adequate amount of tension in the ligaments. The wide-awake approach to wrist surgery is a plausible and reliable technique that eliminates the need for general anesthesia, removes the need of a tourniquet, and provides a cost-efficient and safe approach to wrist surgery. The ability to control ligament reconstructions using active motion may additionally enhance the rehabilitation of these patients, both through early proprioceptive awareness and adequate tensioning of soft tissues.

"The role of wrist magnetic resonance arthrography in diagnosing triangular fibrocartilage complex tears: experience at king hussein medical center, jordan.","OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) of the wrist in detecting full-thickness tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and to compare the results of the magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) with the gold standard arthroscopic findings.METHODS: The study was performed at King Hussein Medical Center, Amman, Jordan, between January 2008 and December 2011. A total of 42 patients (35 males and 7 females) who had ulnar-sided wrist pain and clinical suspicions of TFCC tears were included in the study. All patients underwent wrist magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) and then a wrist arthroscopy. The results of MRA were compared with the arthroscopic findings.RESULTS: After comparison with the arthroscopic findings, the MRA had three false-negative results (sensitivity = 93%) and no false-positive results. A total of 39 patients were able to return to work. Satisfaction was high in 38 of the patients and 33 had satisfactory pain relief. The sensitivity of the wrist MRA in detecting TFCC full-thickness tears was 93% (39), and specificity was 80% (16/20). The overall accuracy of wrist arthroscopy in detecting a full-thickness tear of the TFCC in our study was 85% (29/34).CONCLUSION: These results illustrate the role of wrist MRA in assessing the TFCC pathology and suggest its use as the first imaging technique, following a plain X-ray, in evaluating patients with chronic ulnar side wrist pain with suspected TFCC injuries.",Sultan Qaboos University medical journal,23862035,2013
Isolated lunotriquetral ligament tears treated with ulnar shortening osteotomy.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate outcomes in a single-surgeon series of ulnar shortening osteotomy for the treatment of traumatic isolated tears to the lunotriquetral interosseous ligament (LTIL).METHODS: This study includes 53 consecutive cases of posttraumatic isolated LTIL tears treated with ulnar shortening osteotomy with minimum 1-year follow-up (range, 1.0-10.6 y). We confirmed all LTIL tears via arthroscopy before performing a precision 2.5-mm oblique osteotomy using a modified Rayhack technique. We assessed outcomes using grip strength measurements and Chun and Palmer's modified Gartland Werley wrist scoring system, which includes subjective and objective outcome measures.RESULTS: Preoperatively, 45 cases were graded as fair (28%; n = 15) or poor (57%; n = 30) on the modified Gartland Werley score. There were insufficient data to calculate grades in 8 cases (15%). At final follow-up, most patients exhibited excellent (51%; n = 27) or good (32%; n = 17) scores, some scored fair (17%; n = 9), and none scored as poor. All subjective and objective variables significantly improved over a mean follow-up of 36 months (range, 12-127 mo). Mean grip strength increased from a value of 23 kg before surgery to 33 kg over the same period, a 41% increase. All patients achieved clinical and radiographic union by 10 months. Osteotomy plates were removed routinely in most cases (89%; n = 47) at a mean of 17 months.CONCLUSIONS: Ulnar shortening osteotomy reduced symptoms of posttraumatic isolated LTIL tears in this single-surgeon series.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,23849735,2013
Outcomes of ulnar shortening osteotomy fixed with a dynamic compression system.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcomes of patients with ulnar impaction syndrome treated with a jig-facilitated, oblique, diaphyseal ulnar shortening osteotomy and fixed with a TriMed (Santa Clarita, CA) ulnar osteotomy compression plate.METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with ulnar impaction syndrome identified 38 patients who had had ulnar shortening osteotomy and fixation with the TriMed dynamic compression system. The following clinical data were obtained: patient age, sex, follow-up range of motion, grip strength, and complications. After a minimum of 2 years after surgery, patients reported complications and completed a Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire.RESULTS: Eight patients were lost to follow-up. Compared to the opposite limb at an average of 8 months after surgery, the remaining 30 patients attained 92% to 97% of wrist and forearm motion and 71% of grip strength. The average Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score was 12 after a minimum of 2 years after surgery. Four patients required plate removal due to irritation. Two patients reported persistent ulnar-sided pain, and 2 other patients developed atrophic nonunions and required autologous bone grafting. There were no infections.CONCLUSIONS: Ulnar shortening osteotomy using the TriMed system yielded good clinical outcomes that are comparable to those previously documented using other systems.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,23830678,2013
"Intrinsic ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex tears of the wrist: comparison of MDCT arthrography, conventional 3-T MRI, and MR arthrography.","PURPOSE: This study compares the diagnostic performance of multidetector CT arthrography (CTA), conventional 3-T MR and MR arthrography (MRA) in detecting intrinsic ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears of the wrist.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten cadaveric wrists of five male subjects with an average age 49.6years (range 26-59years) were evaluated using CTA, conventional 3-T MR and MRA. We assessed the presence of scapholunate ligament (SLL), lunotriquetral ligament (LTL), and TFCC tears using a combination of conventional arthrography and arthroscopy as a gold standard. All images were evaluated in consensus by two musculoskeletal radiologists with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy being calculated.RESULTS: Sensitivities/specificity/accuracy of CTA, conventional MRI, and MRA were 100%/100%/100%, 66%/86%/80%, 100%/86%/90% for the detection of SLL tear, 100%/80%/90%, 60%/80%/70%, 100%/80%/90% for the detection of LTL tear, and 100%/100%/100%, 100%/86%/90%, 100%/100%/100% for the detection of TFCC tear. Overall CTA had the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy among the three investigations while MRA performed better than conventional MR. CTA also had the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identifying which component of the SLL and LTL was torn. Membranous tears of both SLL and LTL were better visualized than dorsal or volar tears on all three imaging modalities.CONCLUSION: Both CT and MR arthrography have a very high degree of accuracy for diagnosing tears of the SLL, LTL, and TFCC with both being more accurate than conventional MR imaging.",Skeletal radiology,23812413,2013
Functional outcome of arthroscopic assisted fixation of distal radius fractures.,"BACKGROUND: Many studies in literature have supported the role of wrist arthroscopy as an adjunct to the stable fixation of unstable intraarticular distal radial fractures. This article focuses on the surgical technique, indications, advantages, and results using wrist arthroscopy to assess articular reduction and evaluates the treatment of carpal ligament injuries and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries in conjunction with the stable fixation of distal radial fractures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 27 patients (16 males and 11 females), who underwent stable fixation of intraarticular distal radial fractures with arthroscopic evaluation of the articular reduction and repair of associated carpal injuries. As per the AO classification, they were 9 C 1, 12 C2, 2 C3, 3 B 1, and 1 B2 fractures. The final results were evaluated by modified Mayo wrist scoring system. The average age was 41 years (range: 18-68 years). The average followup was of 26 months (range 24-52 months).RESULTS: Five patients needed modification of the reduction and fixation after arthroscopic joint evaluation. Associated ligament lesions found during the wrist arthroscopy were TFCC tears (n=17), scapholunate ligament injury (n=8), and luno-triquetral ligament injury (n=1). Five patients had combined injuries i.e. included TFCC tear, scapholunate and/or lunotriquetral ligament tear. There were 20 excellent, 3 good, and 4 fair results using this score.CONCLUSION: The radiocarpal and mid carpal arthroscopy is a useful adjunct to stable fixation of distal radial fractures.",Indian journal of orthopaedics,23798761,2013
3-T direct MR arthrography of the wrist: value of finger trap distraction to assess intrinsic ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"PURPOSE: To determine the value of applying finger trap distraction during direct MR arthrography of the wrist to assess intrinsic ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients were prospectively investigated by three-compartment wrist MR arthrography. Imaging was performed with 3-T scanners using a three-dimensional isotropic (0.4 mm) T1-weighted gradient-recalled echo sequence, with and without finger trap distraction (4 kg). In a blind and independent fashion, two musculoskeletal radiologists measured the width of the scapholunate (SL), lunotriquetral (LT) and ulna-TFC (UTFC) joint spaces. They evaluated the amount of contrast medium within these spaces using a four-point scale, and assessed SL, LT and TFCC tears, as well as the disruption of Gilula's carpal arcs.RESULTS: With finger trap distraction, both readers found a significant increase in width of the SL space (mean Δ = +0.1mm, p ≤ 0.040), and noticed more contrast medium therein (p ≤ 0.035). In contrast, the differences in width of the LT (mean Δ = +0.1 mm, p ≥ 0.057) and UTFC (mean Δ = 0mm, p ≥ 0.728) spaces, as well as the amount of contrast material within these spaces were not statistically significant (p = 0.607 and ≥ 0.157, respectively). Both readers detected more SL (Δ = +1, p = 0.157) and LT (Δ = +2, p = 0.223) tears, although statistical significance was not reached, and Gilula's carpal arcs were more frequently disrupted during finger trap distraction (Δ = +5, p = 0.025).CONCLUSION: The application of finger trap distraction during direct wrist MR arthrography may enhance both detection and characterisation of SL and LT ligament tears by widening the SL space and increasing the amount of contrast within the SL and LT joint spaces.",European journal of radiology,23743056,2013
Distal radioulnar joint instability: a review of literature.,"Distal radioulnar joint instability most commonly accompanies fractures of the distal radius and is directly caused by lesion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, which is the major structure responsible for congruity of the distal radioulnar joint. Acute instability accompanying fractures of the distal radius usually does not require separate management, if the fracture itself is firmly fixated. Chronic instabilities causing persistent pain and wrist dysfunction are treated by arthroscopic reinsertion of the torn attachments of the triangular fibrocartilage. If not possible, radioulnar functional tenodesis is performed using palmaris longus tendon graft, thus restoring joint stability.",Polish orthopedics and traumatology,23493197,2013
Galeazzi fracture with volar dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint.,Galeazzi fracture dislocations are fractures of the distal one-third of the radial diaphysis with traumatic disruption of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). This injury results in subluxation or dislocation of the ulnar head. We present a case of a Galeazzi fracture with a volar dislocation of the DRUJ. Open reduction of the DRUJ with Kirschner wire fixation in pronation was necessary to reduce the joint and maintain anatomic alignment. Repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex was also necessary to maintain stability of the DRUJ.,"American journal of orthopedics (Belle Mead, N.J.)",23431520,2013
Coexisting intraarticular disorders are unrelated to outcomes after arthroscopic resection of dorsal wrist ganglions.,"BACKGROUND: Dorsal wrist ganglions are one of the most frequently encountered problems of the wrist and often are associated with intraarticular disorders. However, it is unclear whether coexisting intraarticular disorders influence persistent pain or recurrence after arthroscopic resection of dorsal wrist ganglions.PURPOSES: We investigated (1) which intraarticular disorders coexist with dorsal wrist ganglions and (2) whether they influenced pain, function, and recurrence after arthroscopic ganglion resection.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 41 patients with primary dorsal wrist ganglions who underwent arthroscopic resection. We also obtained VAS pain scores and the Mayo Wrist Scores (MWS) preoperatively and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter postoperatively. Minimum followup was 24 months (mean, 38.9 months; range, 24-60 months).RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had other coexisting intraarticular disorders: 18 triangular fibrocartilage complex tears and nine intrinsic ligament tears. All coexisting disorders were treated simultaneously. Two years after surgery, the mean VAS pain score decreased from 2.4 to 0.6, and mean grip strength increased from 28 to 36 kg of force. The mean active flexion-extension showed no change. The mean MWS improved from 74 to 91. Three ganglions recurred. There was no difference in mean VAS pain score and MWS preoperatively and at 2 years after surgery or recurrence of ganglions between patients with or without coexisting lesions.CONCLUSIONS: Intraarticular disorders commonly coexist with ganglions but we found they were unrelated to pain, function, and recurrence after arthroscopic resection of the ganglion when the intraarticular disorders were treated simultaneously.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

The beauty of stability: distal radioulnar joint stability in arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex repair.,"The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) has an important role in the stability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) stability. We designed a new method of TFCC tear repair that has satisfactory post-operative DRUJ stability. From May 2004 to August 2010, 14 patients who underwent this operation were reviewed. The average post-operative follow-up period was 8.2 months; 66.7% of the patients with TFCC tear in sigmoid notch had clinical DRUJ instability, while only 50% of tear in fovea and 16.7% of tear in base of ulnar styloid had clinical DRUJ instability. Transosseous suture via inside-outside technique was used for repair. At the final follow-up, all 14 patients have soft end point with &lt; 5 mm translations of the DRUJ shown by the stress test. Based on this small sample with satisfactory outcome assessed by the Mayo modified wrist score and DRUJ stability, we recommend TFCC tear in sigmoid notch, which has a higher chance of DRUJ instability, to be repaired by transosseous suture.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,23413845,2013
Thermal energy for the arthroscopic treatment of tears of the triangular fibrocartilage of the wrist.,"We evaluated the clinical and occupational outcomes of arthroscopic treatment with electrothermal shrinkage for triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears. We retrospectively reviewed 162 patients. All patients had ulnar-sided wrist pain that limited their occupational and sporting activities. The surgical technique consisted of electrothermal collagen shrinkage of the TFCC. Pain relief, range of motion, complications, reoperation rate, time to return to work and workers' compensation claims were evaluated. Exclusion criteria were distal radioulnar joint instability and association of other wrist lesions. Complete pain relief was noted in 80.3% of the patients, incomplete pain relief in 14.8%, and only 4.9% required reoperation because of pain-persistence. The average range of motion was over 90% compared to the opposite hand. Worker's compensation claims were introduced by 20 patients, of which 6 did not return to their previous occupation. Electrodiathermy may be a useful option for arthroscopic treatment of TFCC tears in cases without distal radioulnar joint instability.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,23409566,2013
Reconstructed animation from four-phase grip MRI of the wrist with ulnar-sided pain.,"In order to visualize dynamic variations related to ulnar-sided wrist pain, animation was reconstructed from T2* coronal-sectioned magnetic resonance imaging in each of the four phases of grip motion for nine wrists in patients with ulnar pain. Eight of the nine wrists showed a positive ulnar variance of less than 2 mm. Ulnocarpal impaction and triangular fibrocartilage complex injury were assessed on the basis of animation and arthroscopy, respectively. Animation revealed ulnocarpal impaction in four wrists. In one of the four wrists, the torn portion of the articular disc was impinged between the ulnar head and ulnar proximal side of the lunate. In another wrist, the ulnar head impacted the lunate directly through the defect in the articular disc that had previously been excised. An ulnar shortening osteotomy successfully relieved ulnar wrist pain in all four cases with both ulnocarpal impaction and Palmer's Class II triangular fibrocartilage complex tears. This method demonstrated impairment of the articular disc and longitudinal instability of the distal radioulnar joint simultaneously and should be of value in investigating dynamic pathophysiology causing ulnar wrist pain.

Arthroscopically assisted repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex foveal tears.,"PURPOSE: To give a detailed clinical outcome analysis of a consecutive series of patients treated arthroscopically for traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) foveal tears.METHODS: This study was a consecutive case series of 11 patients who underwent arthroscopically assisted repair for traumatic TFCC foveal lesions. The mean age at the time of surgery was 27 years. The mean follow-up was 30 months (range, 20-51 mo). All patients underwent arthroscopy-assisted foveal reattachment of the TFCC by means of a transosseous outside-in technique. The primary outcome measure was a self-administered upper limb disability questionnaire (Hand20 questionnaire) at the final follow-up. The Hand20 scores range from 0 to 100, with high scores indicating severe disability. Secondary outcome measures included pain, grip strength, range of motion, distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability, and the Mayo Modified Wrist Score. We assessed postoperative complications for all patients.RESULTS: The mean preoperative Hand20 score was 29; it decreased significantly to 6 at final follow-up. Pain completely resolved in 7 patients, whereas mild pain during activity persisted in 4 patients. Grip strength improved significantly after surgery, from 84% to 98% of the unaffected side. Nine patients had no DRUJ instability and 2 had mild DRUJ instability at final follow-up. The Mayo Modified Wrist Score at final follow-up was 94 points; results were excellent in 7 patients, good in 3, and fair in 1. Skin irritation at the ulnar neck caused by the suture thread was recognized as a postoperative complication in 3 patients.CONCLUSIONS: Transosseous arthroscopic repair for traumatic TFCC foveal tear can restore stability to the DRUJ and provide satisfactory subjective and objective results without serious complications after more than 20 months' follow-up.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,23351910,2013
Arthroscopic reconstruction of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) with tendon graft for chronic DRUJ instability.,"PURPOSE: To report the 10-years' experience of a novel arthroscopic assisted anatomical TFCC reconstruction in treatment of chronic DRUJ instability resulting from irreparable TFCC injuries.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 patients (7 males, 8 females) with mean age of 37 (17-49) suffering from irreparable TFCC injuries received arthroscopic assisted reconstruction using palmaris longus graft. Three skin incisions were made with creation of one radial and one ulna tunnel for passage of graft following the path of dorsal and palmar radio-ulnar ligaments under fluoroscopic and arthroscopic guidance. The joint capsule was kept intact. Early mid-range forearm rotation was started since 4th week postoperatively.RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 85.53 months (32-138). Mayo wrist score improved from 62.5 to 88 (p&lt;0.05). Comparing contralateral side, total prono-supination range increased from 76.6% to 92.1% and grip strength increased from 56.1% to 76.9%. Twelve patients resumed previous jobs. No evidence of DRUJ arthritis was noticed. Complications included 2 late graft ruptures and one unexplained dystonia.CONCLUSIONS: Our arthroscopic assisted approach on TFCC reconstruction is safe, produces comparable results as the standard technique and may achieve better range of motion with less soft tissue dissection and earlier mobilization.",Injury,23337702,2013
Qualitative and quantitative assessment of wrist MRI at 3.0T: comparison between isotropic 3D turbo spin echo and isotropic 3D fast field echo and 2D turbo spin echo.,"BACKGROUND: Isotropic three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been applied to various joints. However, comparison for image quality between isotropic 3D MRI and two-dimensional (2D) turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence of the wrist at a 3T MR system has not been investigated.PURPOSE: To compare the image quality of isotropic 3D MRI including TSE intermediate-weighted (VISTA) sequence and fast field echo (FFE) sequence with 2D TSE intermediate-weighted sequence of the wrist joint at 3.0 T.MATERIAL AND METHODS: MRI was performed in 10 wrists of 10 healthy volunteers with isotropic 3D sequences (VISTA and FFE) and 2D TSE intermediate-weighted sequences at 3.0 T. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was obtained by imaging phantom and noise-only image. Contrast ratios (CRs) were calculated between fluid and cartilage, triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), and the scapholunate ligament. Two radiologists independently assessed the visibility of TFCC, carpal ligaments, cartilage, tendons and nerves with a four-point grading scale. Statistical analysis to compare CRs (one way ANOVA with a Tukey test) and grades of visibility (Kruskal-Wallis test) between three sequences and those for inter-observer agreement (kappa analysis) were performed.RESULTS: The SNR of 2D TSE (46.26) was higher than those of VISTA (23.34) and 3D FFE (19.41). CRs were superior in 2D TSE than VISTA (P = 0.02) for fluid-cartilage and in 2D TSE than 3D FFE (P &lt; 0.01) for fluid-TFCC. The visibility was best in 2D TSE (P &lt; 0.01) for TFCC and in VISTA (P = 0.01) for scapholunate ligament. The visibility was better in 2D TSE and 3D FFE (P = 0.04) for cartilage and in VISTA than 3D FFE (P &lt; 0.01) for TFCC. The inter-observer agreement for the visibility of anatomic structures was moderate or substantial.CONCLUSION: Image quality of 2D TSE was superior to isotropic 3D MR imaging for cartilage, and TFCC. 3D FFE has better visibility for cartilage than VISTA and VISTA has superior visibility for TFCC to 3D FFE and the visibility for scapholunate ligament was best on VISTA.","Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)",23319720,2013
The effects of dorsally angulated distal radius fractures on distal radioulnar joint stability: a biomechanical study.,"Relationship between dorsal tilt of the distal radius and distal radioulnar joint stability was examined. Stiffness in dorsopalmar displacement of the radius (distal radioulnar joint stiffness) was recorded at 10° intervals until 30° of dorsal angulation from 10° of palmar tilt. Tests were repeated after partial sectioning of the radioulnar ligament, then after complete sectioning of the radioulnar ligament. All data were compared with control (intact triangular fibrocartilage complex, 10° of palmar tilt). The distal radioulnar joint stiffness in dorsal translation decreased significantly with dorsal tilt 10° and 20° in pronation. Partial sectioning of the radioulnar ligament indicated a decrease of the distal radioulnar joint stiffness in the dorsal translation at neutral tilt to 20° of dorsal tilt in the neutral position and in pronation. Distal radioulnar joint stiffness decreased significantly in both dorsal and palmar translations in all forearm positions at 10° and 20° of dorsal tilt. From these findings, the dorsal angulation of the radius should be corrected to less than 10° of dorsal tilt. ","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",23303832,2013
The effect of additional video documentation to photo documentation in wrist arthroscopies on intra- and interobserver reliability.,"INTRODUCTION: The reproducibility of diagnoses based on photo documents in wrist arthroscopies is limited and is expected to improve through the addition of video documents.AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of additional video documentation to photo documentation on intra- and interobserver reliability in wrist arthroscopies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty consecutive arthroscopies were documented by photographs of at least eight standard views and videos of the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints. After 3 months, the photographs and then the photographs together with the videos were reevaluated by the surgeon and by two hand surgeons to determine intra- and interobserver reliability. Percentage agreement and kappa coefficients were calculated.RESULTS: Using videos along with the photographs did not improve reproducibility in general. The assessments of the cartilage status were even worse. Some of the videos were criticized as being too short to allow adequate assessment of the cartilage. Lesions of the TFCC as well as its tension were assessed notably better by the videos, whereas assessment of SL and LT ligaments was not improved by the videos. Intraobserver reliability was better than interobserver reliability.CONCLUSION: As long as videos do not meet further quality criteria, they are not able to improve reliability in general. Nevertheless, videos should be used for documentation of the TFCC.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,23254378,2012
[Pathology of wrist ligaments. 32 lesions of the carpal triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Prognostic significance of associated luno-triquetral lesions].,"Trauma of the wrist is often responsible for multiple ligament injuries. We wanted to know if the association of a luno-triquetral ligament lesion and a triangular fibrocartilage disc lesion has a poor prognosis. We reviewed 32 patients with a traumatic injury of the triangular ligament, with a mean age of 35 years, and 32 months of follow up. The functional scores used were the Modified Mayo Wrist score, the Quick DASH score, and the Herzberg score. Patients were classified according to the severity of luno-triquetral lesions, in conformity with the Geissler's classification. Ten patients had a healthy ligament, 11 a stable lesion stage 1 and 11 an unstable lesion stage 2, 3 or 4. The joint mobility averages were 59.5° in flexion, 64.2° in extension, a pronation of 71.3°, a supination of 74.1°, an ulnar inclination of 33.8° and a radial inclination of 16.8°. The Modified Mayo Wrist score average was 75/100, the Herzberg score average was 81.5/100 and the average of the Quick DASH 8/100. The patients were all very satisfied or satisfied with their intervention. There was no statistically significant difference between the three groups studied regarding mobility and functional scores. In this study, an associated luno-triquetral ligament injury does not seem to worsen the functional outcome after surgery, provided appropriate treatment had been performed. However, a larger patient sample is needed to verify these findings.",Chirurgie de la main,23182183,2012
"Clinical, radiographic, and arthroscopic outcomes after ulnar shortening osteotomy: a long-term follow-up study.","PURPOSE: Previous studies have investigated the long-term outcomes of ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO) in the treatment of ulnocarpal abutment syndrome (UCA), but none have used arthroscopic assessments. The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes of USO with patient-based, arthroscopic, and radiographic assessments.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients with UCA after a minimum follow-up of 5 years, with arthroscopic evaluations at the time of both USO and plate removal. We confirmed the initial diagnosis of UCA by radiography and arthroscopy. Mean age at the time of index surgery was 37 years. Mean duration of follow-up was 11 years (range, 5-19 y). We obtained Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand and Hand20 self-assessments postoperatively for all patients. Bony spur formation was evaluated postoperatively from plain radiographs.RESULTS: We detected triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) disc tear in 13 wrists arthroscopically at the time of USO. Of these, 10 showed no evidence of TFCC disc tear at second-look arthroscopy. The remaining 17 cases showed no TFCC disc tear at either first- or second-look arthroscopy. Follow-up radiography revealed that bony spurs at the distal radioulnar joint had progressed in 13 wrists. Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm, and Hand and Hand20 scores did not significantly correlate with the presence of bony spurs or TFCC disc tears. Range of motion decreased significantly with age only. Lower grip strength correlated with bony spur and lower radial inclination. Triangular fibrocartilage complex tear, male sex, and advanced age were associated with lower Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm, and Hand and Hand20 scores.CONCLUSIONS: Ulnar shortening osteotomy achieved excellent long-term results in most cases. Most TFCC disc tears identified at the initial surgery had healed by long-term arthroscopic follow-up. We suggest that UCA with a TFCC disc tear is a good indication for USO.",The Journal of hand surgery,23174060,2012
Distal radioulnar joint injuries.,"Distal radioulnar joint is a trochoid joint relatively new in evolution. Along with proximal radioulnar joint, forearm bones and interosseous membrane, it allows pronosupination and load transmission across the wrist. Injuries around distal radioulnar joint are not uncommon, and are usually associated with distal radius fractures,fractures of the ulnar styloid and with the eponymous Galeazzi or Essex_Lopresti fractures. The injury can be purely involving the soft tissue especially the triangular fibrocartilage or the radioulnar ligaments. The patients usually present with ulnar sided wrist pain, features of instability, or restriction of rotation. Difficulty in carrying loads in the hand is a major constraint for these patients. Thorough clinical examination to localize point of tenderness and appropriate provocative tests help in diagnosis. Radiology and MRI are extremely useful, while arthroscopy is the gold standard for evaluation. The treatment protocols are continuously evolving and range from conservative, arthroscopic to open surgical methods. Isolated dislocation are uncommon. Basal fractures of the ulnar styloid tend to make the joint unstable and may require operative intervention. Chronic instability requires reconstruction of the stabilizing ligaments to avoid onset of arthritis. Prosthetic replacement in arthritis is gaining acceptance in the management of arthritis.",Indian journal of orthopaedics,23162140,2012
Subjective and objective results of arthroscopic debridement of ulnar-sided TFCC (Palmer type 1B) lesions with stable distal radio-ulnar joint.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine functional and subjective results of patients who received arthroscopic debridement for their TFCC Palmer 1B lesions and to compare their results with those of arthroscopic suture repair.METHODS: Between March 2007 and August 2011, 36 patients were diagnosed with Palmer type 1B tears and underwent arthroscopic debridement. 31 patients (15 males and 16 females) were followed up for an average of 26.7 months (±17.4 months) postoperatively. Their average age was 36.7 years (±12.7 years). Follow-up included the determination of range of motion (ROM), grip strength, pain, and wrist scores (modified Mayo wrist score (MMWS), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH score)).RESULTS: Postoperative ROM averaged 99.2 % for the extension/flexion arc, 95.5 % for the radial/ulnar deviation arc, and 99.4 % for the pronation/supination arc of motion when compared with the contralateral wrist. The MMWS was rated excellent in 48 % of patients, good in 39 %, fair in 13 %, and poor in 0 %. The average DASH score was 17.02 (±14.92). There was a significant reduction in pain. The grip strength was 96.7 % (±15.8), pulp-to-pulp pinch 101.9 % (±17.4), and the ulnar variance -0.12 ± 1.69 mm.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic debridement of Palmer type 1B lesions in stable DRUJ yields satisfactory to excellent results. Our study showed similar results compared with the studies of arthroscopic suture repair with shorter postoperative care and fewer complications.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,23143290,2012
Biomechanical study of the extensor carpi ulnaris as a dynamic wrist stabilizer.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the dynamic stabilizing effect of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) on the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) and the ulnocarpal joint in a simulated model of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury.METHODS: Using 8 fresh-frozen cadavers, we fixed the humerus and ulna at 90° of elbow flexion, and the radius and hand were allowed to rotate freely around the ulna. Passive mobility was tested by translating the radiocarpal unit relative to the ulna along dorsal-palmar directions. Unit displacement was measured by an electromagnetic tracking device in different forearm rotations and under varied loading to the wrist motor tendons. Magnitudes of displacement were compared between different loading patterns of the prime wrist movers in the TFCC-sectioned wrists. The effect of sectioning the ECU subsheath was analyzed.RESULTS: When physiological loads were applied to all of the prime wrist movers, the magnitude of displacement during passive mobility testing decreased in supination and neutral rotation. After ECU tendon loading was released, mobility increased again in supination and neutral rotation. When the load was applied only to the ECU tendon, mobility decreased in supination and neutral rotation as compared with unloaded. Little change in the mobility was found in pronation regardless of the tendon loading pattern. After sectioning of the ECU subsheath, the stabilizing effect of the ECU decreased in neutral rotation.CONCLUSIONS: In a neutral wrist position with complete sectioning of the TFCC, the ECU dynamically stabilized the DRUJ and the ulnocarpal joint in supination and neutral forearm rotation. The ECU subsheath assisted ECU tendon stabilization on the ulnar side of the wrist, especially in the neutral rotation.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Maintaining the ECU and its subsheath may reduce DRUJ instability in patients with TFCC injuries.",The Journal of hand surgery,23123149,2012
Arthroscopic repair of ulnar-sided triangular fibrocartilage complex (Palmer Type 1B) tears: a comparison between short- and midterm results.,"PURPOSE: To compare short- and midterm functional and subjective outcomes of arthroscopically repaired Palmer 1B tears.METHODS: At 2 time points, we evaluated 49 patients with Palmer 1B tears who underwent arthroscopic repair. We examined 46 patients (23 males and 23 females) in the short-term at an average of 11 months (range, 6-23 mo) postoperatively. In a second midterm follow-up, we examined 40 patients (20 males and 20 females) an average of 4.8 years (range, 4.2-5.9 y) after repair. Between short- and midterm follow-ups, 6 patients underwent an ulnar-shortening osteotomy to alleviate persistent ulnar-sided symptoms. Objective and subjective evaluation included the determination of range of motion, grip strength, pain, and wrist scores (modified Mayo wrist score and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score).RESULTS: Compared with short-term repair results, midterm outcomes showed a further improvement in pain, wrist scores, grip strength, and motion. Neither static nor dynamic ulnar variance was correlated to preoperative and postoperative Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores, short-term modified Mayo wrist scores, or need for ulnar-shortening osteotomy. Five patients improved only after having received an ulnar shortening osteotomy.CONCLUSIONS: After repair of Palmer 1B lesions, patients continued to improve in function and comfort at least into the second year, although some needed to have the ulna shortened to achieve this result.",The Journal of hand surgery,23101530,2012
Arthroscopic direct repair for radial tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"Although various repair techniques for Palmer type 1B lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) have been introduced, arthroscopic repair techniques for Palmer type 1D lesions are still being honed. Until recently, inside-out techniques have commonly been used to repair radial tears of the TFCC. However, that technique has the disadvantages of a requirement for an extra skin incision, pain resulting from prominent subcutaneous suture knot stacks, and peripheral nerve injury. We describe an all-arthroscopic direct-repair technique using a suture hook with 2-0 polydioxanone that is relatively simple and safe and is thus a useful alternative for radial tears of the TFCC.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,23061960,2012
The athlete's wrist: ulnar-sided pain.,"Ulnar-sided wrist pain is one of the most common symptoms in athletes of baseball, racket sports, golf, and wrestling where there is frequent use of the hands as well as in soccer and running, where hand use is minimal. Compared with all wrist injuries, ulnar-sided wrist injury is a relatively serious condition for athletes because it plays an important role in performing a strong grip and in the rotation of the forearm. Ulnar-sided wrist pain in athletes can be related to acute trauma or chronic overuse. Acute trauma can lead to bone fractures and sprains/tears of ligaments. Repetitive mechanical stresses to tendons, ligaments, and the joint structures can lead to tendinitis or osteoarthrosis. Diagnosis of the ulnar-sided wrist pain is challenging both for hand surgeons and radiologists because of the small and complex anatomy. In the present article, we discuss mechanisms of wrist injury, sports-specific ulnar-sided wrist injuries, and the differential diagnosis of ulnar-sided wrist pain.",Seminars in musculoskeletal radiology,23047280,2012
Palmar reconstruction of the triangular fibrocartilage complex for instability of the distal radioulnar joint: a biomechanical study.,"We developed a new triangular fibrocartilage complex reconstruction technique for distal radioulnar joint instability in which the palmar portion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex was predominantly reconstructed, and evaluated whether such reconstruction can restore stability of the distal radioulnar joint in seven fresh cadaver upper extremities. Distal radioulnar joint instability was induced by cutting all soft-tissue stabilizers around the distal ulna. Using a palmar approach, a palmaris longus tendon graft was sutured to the remnant of the palmar radioulnar and ulnocarpal ligaments. The graft was then passed through a bone tunnel created at the fovea and was sutured. Loads were applied to the radius, and dorsopalmar displacements of the radius relative to the ulna were measured using an electromagnetic tracking device in neutral rotation, 60° supination and 60° pronation. We compared the dorsopalmar displacements before sectioning, before reconstruction and after reconstruction. Dorsopalmar instability produced by sectioning significantly improved in all forearm positions after reconstruction.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",23035003,2012
[Quality rating of MRI regarding TFCC lesions in the clinical practice].,"BACKGROUND: MRI diagnostic is used for wrist pain diagnostic frequently. Clinical studies in specialized centers show high sensitivity and specificity concerning TFCC lesions. The aim of this study is a comparison of MRI and arthroscopy regarding TFCC lesions not in a specialized but in a common medical environment.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively recorded all patients between January 2004 and April 2012 who went through a wrist arthroscopy and had a preoperative MRI. 401 patients were identified, 218 males and 183 females. The average age was 42.4 (12-84) years. 88 examiners of radiological practices in the region of our hospital reported the MRI results used for this research.RESULTS: In 334 cases TFCC lesions could be identified during arthroscopy. MRI showed an average sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 60%. A Palmer classification was reported through MRI in 58 cases. Most frequently, the MRI examiners reported a Palmer 1b lesion. That result could only be verified by arthroscopy in 11 cases.CONCLUSION: Although MRI has an acceptable degree of diagnostic test accuracy in controlled clinical studies, we do not recommend the general use of MRI in diagnosis of ulnocarpal wrist pain.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",23027337,2012
"CT arthrography of the wrist using a novel, mobile, dedicated extremity cone-beam CT (CBCT).","PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and intra- and interobserver agreement of CBCT arthrography of wrist ligaments, triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC), and to assess the sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), accuracy (ACC), and positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) of CBCT arthrography in the diagnosis of scapholunate (SLL) and lunotriquetral (LTL) ligament tears, TFCC, and cartilage abnormalities of the scaphoid and lunate with their corresponding radial surfaces (scaphoid and lunate fossa) using a novel, mobile, dedicated extremity CBCT scanner.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two consecutively enrolled subjects (26 M, 26 F, mean age 38 years, range 18-66 years) with suspected wrist ligament tears underwent CBCT-arthrography before normally scheduled MR arthrography.An extremity CBCT was used for imaging with isotropic voxel size of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm(3). Subsequent routine 1.5 T MRI was performed using a dedicated wrist coil.Two observers reviewed the anonymized CBCT images twice for contrast enhancement (CE) and technical details (TD), for tears of the SLL, LTL, and TFCC. Also, cartilage abnormalities of the scaphoid and lunate with their corresponding radial surfaces (scaphoid and lunate fossa) were evaluated. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was determined using weighted kappa statistics. Since no surgery was performed, MRI served as a reference standard, and SE and SP, ACC, PPV, and NPV were calculated.RESULTS: Intra- and interobserver kappa values for both readers (reader 1/reader 2; first reading/second reading) with 95 % confidence limits were: CE 0.54 (0.08-1.00)/ 0.75 (0.46-1.00); 0.73 (0.29-1.00)/ 0.45 (0.07-0.83), TD 0.53 (0.30-0.88)/ 0.86 (0.60-1.00); 0.56 (0.22-0.91)/ 0.67 (0.37-0.98), SLL 0.59 (0.25-0.93)/ 0.66 (0.42-0.91); 0.31 (0.06-0.56)/ 0.49 (0.26-0.73), LTL 0.83 (0.66-1.00)/ 0.68 (0.46-0.91); 0.90 (0.79-1.00)/ 0.48 (0.22-0.74); TFCC (0.72-1.00)/ (0.79-1.00); 0.65 (0.43-0.87)/ 0.59 (0.35-0.83), radius (scaphoid fossa) 0.45 (0.12-0.77)/ 0.64 (0.31-0.96); 0.58 (0.19-0.96)/ 0.38 (0.09-0.66), scaphoid 0.43 (0.12-0.74)/ 0.76 (0.55-0.96); 0.37 (0.00-0.75)/ 0.32 (0.04-0.59), radius (lunate fossa) 0.68 (0.36-1.00)/ 0.42 (0.00-0.86); 0.62 (0.29-0.96)/ 0.51 (0.12-0.91), and lunate 0.53 (0.16-0.90)/ 0.68 (0.44-0.91); 0.59 (0.29-0.88)/ 0.42 (0.00-0.84), respectively. The overall mean accuracy was 82-92 % and specificity was 81-94 %. Sensitivity for LTL and TFCC tears was 76-83, but for SLL tears it was 58 %. For cartilage abnormalities, the accuracy and negative predictive value were high, 90-98 %.CONCLUSIONS: A dedicated CBCT extremity scanner is a new method for evaluating the wrist ligaments and radiocarpal cartilage. The method has an overall accuracy of 82-86 % and specificity 81-91 %. For cartilage abnormalities, the accuracy and negative predictive value were high.",Skeletal radiology,22990597,2012
The effect of labeling photo documents in wrist arthroscopies on intra- and interobserver reliability.,"INTRODUCTION: The reproducibility of diagnoses based on photo documents in wrist arthroscopies is limited and is expected to improve if the photos are labeled with illustrated structures.AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of labeling photo documents on intra- and interobserver agreement and reliability of standard photo documentation in wrist arthroscopies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Digital photographs of 50 arthroscopies were re-evaluated by the surgeon as well as by two independent hand surgeons. First the photos were presented unlabeled in a random order, then the labeled photos in a uniform order. Intra- and interobserver reliability was assessed, and expressed by kappa coefficients.RESULTS: Overall, labeling the photos resulted in a slight improvement in intra- and interobserver reliability (0.573/0.444/0.420 vs. 0.518/0.412/0.212). The time needed to conceive the photo documents, however, was shortened when the photos were labeled. The cartilage status was assessed considerably more accurately if the photos were labeled (0.556/0.560/0.422 vs. 0.459/0.326/0.240; t test: P = 0.094). Whereas the SL ligament was assessed more accurately according to labeled photos (P = 0.100), the agreement rates for the assessment of other ligament structures (TFCC, LT and radiopalmar ligaments) were not substantially affected by labeling the photos. On re-evaluation of the unlabeled as well as the labeled photos, intraobserver reliability was better than interobserver reliability (0.518 vs. 0.412/0.212 and 0.573 vs. 0.444/0.420).CONCLUSION: Labeling simplifies but does not necessarily improve the reproducibility of photo documents in wrist arthroscopies. To display the cartilage status and the integrity of the SL ligament, digital photo documents should be labeled with the illustrated structure or joint surface.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,22983095,2012
Intrinsic ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears of the wrist: comparison of isovolumetric 3D-THRIVE sequence MR arthrography and conventional MR image at 3 T.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to validate the diagnostic performance of high-resolution isovolumetric magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) for intrinsic ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears of the wrist as compared to conventional MR imaging (MRI).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with traumatic TFCC tears at arthroscopy were enrolled. All patients had underwent proton-density- and T2-weighted MRI before arthrography and three-dimensional T1 high-resolution isovolumetric examination (3D-THRIVE) MRA on a 3-T MR. We assessed the presence of scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL)/lunotriquetral interosseous ligament (LTIL) or TFCC tears using the arthroscopy as a gold standard.RESULTS: Arthroscopy revealed 37 TFCC central tears, 15 TFCC peripheral tears, 20 SLIL tears and 13 LTIL tears. Sensitivities of MRI and MRA were 70.3% and 94.6% for detection of TFCC central tears, 60.0% and 93.3% for detection of TFCC peripheral tears, 65.0% and 85.0% for SLIL tears, and 61.5% and 84.6% for LTIL tears. The specificity of the MRI was 100% for the detection of ligaments and TFCC tears. The specificities of the MRA for detection of TFCC central tears, TFCC peripheral tears, SLIL tears and LTIL tears were 100%, 97%, 96.4% and 100%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Isovolumetric 3D-THRIVE wrist MRA provided better results for depiction of intrinsic ligament and TFCC tears than wrist MRI.",Magnetic resonance imaging,22959873,2012
Pathomorphologic findings of wrist arthroscopy in children and adolescents with chronic wrist pain.,"PURPOSE: The purposes of this diagnostic study were to show pathomorphologic findings of children and adolescents with persistent wrist pain and to compare these arthroscopic findings with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).METHODS: A total of 41 arthroscopies in 39 patients were retrospectively reviewed. The patients underwent diagnostic wrist arthroscopy because of persistent wrist pain after at least 3 months of unsuccessful conservative treatment. Of the patients, 22 (56.4%) reported an injury before the onset of pain. The mean age at arthroscopy was 15.3 years (range, 9.8 to 19.4 years), and the mean duration between the onset of symptoms and arthroscopic exploration was 19.9 months (range, 3.0 to 121.0 months).RESULTS: Among all affected wrists, 33 (80.5%) showed a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear on arthroscopy, with 75.6% also showing other pathomorphologic findings. Retrospectively, the condition of the TFCC was correctly identified by MRI in only 17 wrists (41.5%). In contrast, 23 wrists were incorrectly classified as having &quot;no tear&quot; whereas arthroscopy later indeed showed a TFCC tear. Concerning the TFCC, MRI and arthroscopy showed a significant difference of outcome (P &lt; .01), indicating low agreement (κ = 0.09) for the outcome of the 2 methods. A larger proportion of TFCC tears was found for patients with injuries (91.3%) as compared with the other patients (66.7%), although this was not significant on statistical analysis (P = .11). No significant difference in the time to surgery was found between patients with TFCC tears and those without TFCC tears classified by MRI (P = .76) and by arthroscopy (P = .99).CONCLUSIONS: Wrist arthroscopy in children and adolescents with chronic wrist pain shows TFCC lesions in a high percentage. However, most of these lesions have not been correctly identified by MRI before arthroscopy. Thus diagnostic wrist arthroscopy may be recommended to rule out underlying pathologies and initiate further therapeutic steps.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, diagnostic study of nonconsecutive patients.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,22951372,2012
Current innovations in wrist arthroscopy.,"It has become clear that the stability of the scapholunate joint does not depend wholly on the scapholunate interosseous ligament, but rather on both primary and secondary stabilizers, which form a scapholunate ligament complex. Each case of scapholunate instability is unique and should be treated with tissue-specific repairs, which may partly explain why one procedure cannot successfully restore joint stability in every case. Wrist arthroscopy has a pivotal role in both the assessment and treatment of the scapholunate ligament complex derangements. Tears of the foveal attachment of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex can be an underdiagnosed cause of distal radioulnar joint instability, because the foveal fibers cannot be visualized using the standard radiocarpal arthroscopy portals. Distal radioulnar joint arthroscopy allows for direct visualization and assessment of these fibers, which in turn has spawned a number of open and arthroscopic repair methods. Wrist arthroscopy has gained wider acceptance as a method to fine-tune articular reduction during open and percutaneous fixation of distal radius fractures, and simplifies intra-articular osteotomies for malunion. It can facilitate percutaneous bone grafting of scaphoid nonunions and has a role in the diagnosis and treatment of associated soft tissue lesions. These and other recent developments will be discussed in the following article.",The Journal of hand surgery,22916867,2012
The management of ulnocarpal abutment and degenerative triangular fibrocartilage complex tears in the competitive athlete.,"Ulnar-sided wrist pain is a frequent cause for loss of practice time and competitive play for athletes. Ulnocarpal abutment, a common source of ulnar-sided pain, typically burdens athletes who participate in gymnastics, racket sports, and baseball. Although many athletes respond to nonoperative management, surgical intervention should be considered when symptoms persist. Surgical options include arthroscopic debridement, arthroscopic wafer, open wafer, or ulnar-shortening osteotomy. Treatment should be tailored to the athletes' level of function, expectations, and goals. The timing of interventions also influences the treatment algorithm. A successful outcome can be anticipated when appropriate treatment is rendered.",Hand clinics,22883875,2012
Triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries in the elite athlete.,"Injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in athletes can be caused by acute trauma, chronic repetitive loading, or a combination of both. Regardless of cause, the management of TFCC injuries in the high-performance athlete is often different from the basic tenets applied to the general population. The diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation regimen should be individualized and sport-specific in athletes, taking into consideration the priorities and needs of the athlete while striking a balance between healing, return to play, and long-term well-being.",Hand clinics,22883871,2012
The natural course of traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex tears in distal radial fractures: a 13-15 year follow-up of arthroscopically diagnosed but untreated injuries.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of a prospective, longitudinal case series of untreated, traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears found in displaced distal radial fractures.METHODS: Between 1995 and 1997, 51 patients (24 men, 27 women; age, 20-57 y) with a displaced distal radius fracture had wrist arthroscopy to identify associated injuries. Forty-three patients had complete or partial tears of the TFCC, which were not treated. All patients were contacted in 2010, 13-15 years after the injury. One patient had had a TFCC reattachment due to painful distal radioulnar joint instability and was excluded. Thirty-eight patients returned for a radiographic and clinical follow-up that recorded strength, distal radioulnar joint laxity, range of motion, pain scale score, and subjective and objective outcome scores.RESULTS: After 13-15 years, 17/38 patients were lax in the distal radioulnar joint. The mean grip strength was worse in the patients with a lax distal radioulnar joint (83%, SD 15 of the contralateral side vs 103%, SD 33). The median Gartland and Werley score was 5 (good; range, 0-15) in the lax group compared to 1 (excellent; range, 0-9) in the non-lax group, and the median Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores were 14 (range, 0-59) and 5 (range, 0-70) respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In this 13-15 year, prospective, longitudinal outcome study of the natural course of TFCC tears associated with distal radius fracture, only 1 patient had been operated on for painful instability since the injury. The subjective and objective results did not provide evidence that a TFCC injury would influence the long-term outcome. However, trends were found and, by speculation, the low number of patients in the series and the risk for a type II error could be the cause of absent statistically significance. Larger, preferably prospective, randomized studies are needed to find out whether a more aggressive treatment is beneficial.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic I.",The Journal of hand surgery,22835585,2012
A new definition of wrist sprain necessary after findings in a prospective MRI study.,"INTRODUCTION: Wrist injuries with negative X-rays are diagnosed as acute wrist sprains. The prognosis is usually good, but some patients suffer from long-lasting pain and reduced wrist function, probably due to missed diagnosis followed by inappropriate treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate acute wrist sprains with MRI to detect the pathoanatomy of the injury.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study included patients between 18 and 49 years, who attended the Accident and Emergency Department (A&amp;E) Bergen, Norway, after sustaining an acute wrist trauma within the previous week. Initial X-rays of the wrist were normal. MRI was done within a median of 1 day (range 0-31 days) after the trauma, 80% within 4 days. The study period lasted from 5 November 2009 to 4 November 2010.RESULTS: A total of 155 acute MRIs were done, out of which 30 were completely normal. Patients with positive MRI had a median of two (range 0-8) pathological findings. We found 54 fractures and 56 bone bruises, mostly located to the radius followed by the scaphoid, the triquetrum, the capitate and the lunate. There were 73 soft-tissue injuries, which included 15 injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and five scapho-lunate (SL) ligament lesions.CONCLUSIONS: Wrist sprain is an inaccurate diagnosis. In four out of five patients with normal X-rays, MRI identified pathological findings and a large variety of injuries in different structures. We suggest that wrist sprain should be defined as &quot;occult partial or complete soft tissue (ligament, tendon, muscle) or bony injury in relation to a trauma with negative X-ray&quot;. The MRI findings led to a more differentiated treatment in more than a third of the patients. We recommend that MRI should be considered as a part of an early investigation, especially when the wrist pain does not settle within the first couple of weeks.",Injury,22819266,2012
[Treatment of distal radioulnar joint osteoarthritis].,"The distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) plays a key role in stable forearm rotation. The main stabilizer of the DRUJ is the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC). If the integrity of the DRUJ is disturbed, commonly after distal radius fractures, osteoarthritis may develop. For the surgical treatment of osteoarthritis, different techniques are available and in most cases salvage procedures (Darrach, Bowers and Sauvé-Kapandji operations) are performed which generally promise reasonable results but include the potential risk of radioulnar instability which can lead to pain and weakness. Soft tissue stabilizing techniques have only limited success rates. In an attempt to mechanically stabilize the distal forearm following ulnar head resection various endoprostheses have been developed to replace the ulnar head. The prostheses can be used for the secondary treatment of failed ulnar head resection but can also achieve good results in the primary treatment of osteoarthritis of the DRUJ.",Der Unfallchirurg,22806223,2012
Ganglions of the wrist and associated triangular fibrocartilage lesions: a prospective study in arthroscopically-treated patients.,"PURPOSE: Wrist ganglions are the most common soft tissue tumors of the hand and wrist and can occur at any age. Their etiology remains controversial. A high prevalence of associated intrinsic ligamentous lesions has been described. We hypothesized that painful wrist ganglions are an indicator of an underlying joint abnormality, particularly of lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). The aim of our study was to prospectively determine the prevalence of associated TFCC lesions in patients with painful wrist ganglions.METHODS: Forty-six patients (35 women, 11 men; mean age, 36 ± 11 y; range, 18-57 y) with painful wrist ganglions (20 radiopalmar and 26 dorsal) had surgery from January 2008 to June 2010. There were 18 primary and 28 recurrent ganglions. Clinical examinations, pain score evaluations, disabilities in daily life evaluations, plain radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging were obtained before arthroscopic resection. Concomitant intrinsic lesions of the wrist were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging and re-evaluated by arthroscopy.RESULTS: All ganglions were successfully resected. Overall, arthroscopy identified 22 TFCC lesions (48%) and 2 intracarpal ligament lesions. The TFCC perforations were more commonly associated with radiopalmar ganglions with a positive ulnocarpal stress test result and with recurrent radiopalmar ganglions. At 1-year follow-up, all patients were meaningfully improved in terms of pain and disabilities in daily life.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopy allows for the simultaneous treatment of ganglions and other pathologies. Therefore, arthroscopy should be contemplated as the primary treatment option for patients with painful ganglions of the wrist if they are in a radiopalmar location with a positive ulnocarpal stress test and for patients with recurrent radiopalmar ganglions, which are also highly associated with TFCC abnormalities.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,22749480,2012
Various patterns of traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex tear.,"We demonstrate various patterns of traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears including some atypical that cannot be categorized under Palmer's classification. TFCC traumatic tears in 173 wrists were examined arthroscopically or macroscopically and divided into disk tears (subdivided into four types: slit tear, flap tear, horizontal tear and tear within the distal radioulnar joint) and peripheral tears (subdivided into six types: ulnocarpal ligament tear, dorsal tear, radial tear, ulnar styloid tear, foveal tear and distal radioulnar ligament tear). Combinations of these types were found in 32 wrists. Wrist arthroscopy revealed various traumatic TFCC tears that do not come under Palmer's classification; therefore establishment of a new classification for traumatic TFCC tears seems to be warranted.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,22745082,2012

Presentation can vary from acute traumatic injuries to chronic degenerative conditions. Because of its overlapping anatomy, complex differential diagnosis, and varied treatment outcomes, the ulnar side of the wrist has been referred to as the &quot;black box&quot; of the wrist, and its pathology has been compared with low back pain. Common causes of ulnar-sided wrist pain include triangular fibrocartilaginous complex injuries, lunotriquetrial ligament injuries, and ulnar impaction syndrome.",The Journal of hand surgery,22721461,2012
[Therapy of triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions].,"The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) represents an important anatomical structure interposed between the ulnar carpus and the distal ulnar. Injuries and degenerative changes of the TFCC are of high clinical relevance and there are numerous treatment options available based on different concepts and which are being used to varying extents. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of different therapies for lesions of the TFCC. Studies on TFCC lesions were systematically reviewed, classified into evidence levels and selected according to predefined criteria. A total of 259 publications were identified as being potentially relevant and finally 35 studies could be included in the review. In addition, a survey was performed among German hand surgeons in order to identify commonly used procedures for TFCC lesions in Germany. The classification of Palmer is mostly used both in the literature and in Germany and therapeutic decisions are predominantly based on this classification. The systematic review revealed some common treatment strategies for traumatic and degenerative lesions. Generally, the level of evidence was poor for all identified publications. For this reason, evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of TFCC lesions could not be derived from the literature. There was broad consent between the results of the literature review and the survey.",Der Unfallchirurg,22706650,2012
Clinical and non-clinical aspects of distal radioulnar joint instability.,"Untreated distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) injuries can give rise to long lasting complaints. Although common, diagnosis and treatment of DRUJ injuries remains a challenge. The articulating anatomy of the distal radius and ulna, among others, enables an extensive range of forearm pronosupination movements. Stabilization of this joint is provided by both intrinsic and extrinsic stabilizers and the joint capsule. These structures transmit the load and prevent the DRUJ from luxation during movement. Several clinical tests have been suggested to determine static or dynamic DRUJ stability, but their predictive value is unclear. Radiologic evaluation of DRUJ instability begins with conventional radiographs in anterioposterior and true lateral view. If not conclusive, CT-scan seems to be the best additional modality to evaluate the osseous structures. MRI has proven to be more sensitive and specific for TFCC tears, potentially causing DRUJ instability. DRUJ instability may remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic DRUJ injuries treatment can be conservative or operative. Operative treatment should consist of restoration of osseous and ligamenteous anatomy. If not successful, salvage procedures can be performed to regain stability.",The open orthopaedics journal,22675411,2012
Wrist MRI Arthrogram v Wrist Arthroscopy: What are we Finding?,"The aim of the study was to compare the radiological findings of wrist arthrogram with wrist arthroscopy. This allowed us to establish the accuracy (sensitivity, specificity) of MRI arthrogram as a diagnostic tool. Thirty patients (20 female and 10 male) have undergone both wrist MRI arthrogram and wrist arthroscopy over the last 3 years at a District General Hospital. The mean age at arthrogram was 42.4 years with an average 6.7 month interval between the two procedures.The MRI arthrogram was reported by a consultant radiologist with an interest in musculoskeletal imaging and the arthroscopies performed by two upper limb surgeons. Patients who underwent both procedures were identified. The arthrogram reports and operation notes were examined for correlation. Three main areas of pathology were consistently examined: TFCC (triangular fibrocartilage complex), scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligament tears. The sensitivity and specificity of arthrogram was calculated for each. Other areas of pathology were also noted.In the case of TFCC tears MRI arthrogram had 90% sensitivity and 75% specificity. The lunotriquetral ligament examination with this technique was 100% sensitivity and specificity. However for scapholunate ligament tears it only had 91% sensitivity and 88% specificity.Wrist arthrogram and arthroscopy are both invasive techniques. In cost terms the arthrogram remains cheaper but is superseded by arthroscopy as it is both diagnostic and therapeutic.",The open orthopaedics journal,22675410,2012
Anatomy and variants of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and its MR appearance at 3 and 7T.,"Due to the small size and complexity of its constituents, the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) has been a challenging structure for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Higher-field MR units, at 3T and 7T, with increased spatial resolution and the development of novel MR sequences, are promising tools for an improved visualization of the ulnocarpal complex. Anatomically, the TFCC consists of the TFC proper, the ulnomeniscal homolog, the ulnar collateral ligament, the ulnotriquetral and ulnolunate ligament, and radioulnar ligaments at the volar (palmar) and the dorsal side, as well as the sheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon and the capsule of the distal radioulnar joint. This article describes the normal anatomy of the TFCC and its appearance on high-field MRI. Anatomical variants, such as the positive ulnar variance, and changes during pronation and supination are addressed.",Seminars in musculoskeletal radiology,22648425,2012
Peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex tears cause ulnocarpal instability: a biomechanical pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Instability at the ulnocarpal joint has many causes, but the common thread among these causes is the presence of abnormalities in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). However, the biomechanical consequences at the ulnocarpal joint after detachment of the TFCC from the ulnar styloid are not clearly defined. Better delineation of whether peripheral TFCC detachments cause ulnocarpal instability will help to design surgical treatments.PURPOSES: We asked whether detachment of the peripheral TFCC from the ulnar styloid causes ulnocarpal instability.METHODS: Using 20 fresh-frozen below-elbow cadaver specimens, the distal ulna was cycled volarly and dorsally with the carpus held firmly. The load-displacement curve was analyzed to determine the resistance of the ulnocarpal joint against dorsal-volar displacement of the ulna (stiffness) and the amount of dorsal-volar excursion with minimal resistance before reaching firm end points dorsally and volarly. A standardized 3-mm transection of the attachment of the TFCC from the ulnar styloid was created with a scalpel using arthroscopic observation. Mechanical testing was repeated and paired Student's t-tests conducted.RESULTS: The mean stiffness of the ulnocarpal joint was decreased after detachment. The amount of dorsal-volar excursion was similar after detachment of the peripheral TFCC.CONCLUSIONS: There is decreased stiffness at the ulnocarpal joint after detachment of the peripheral TFCC, but there is no biomechanically detectable difference in dorsal-volar excursion.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings of the current study can be used to develop and evaluate innovative surgical techniques, such as capsulorraphy or ligamentous reconstruction, that specifically address laxity at the ulnocarpal joint after peripheral TFCC detachment.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,22644423,2012
Another light in the dark: review of a new method for the arthroscopic repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is an anatomically and biomechanically important structure. Repair of radial-sided TFCC tear has previously been challenging. We designed a new method of radial-sided TFCC tear repair and found that it was also applicable for ulnar-sided TFCC tear repair. From October 2006 to December 2010, 10 patients underwent this operation and were reviewed: 9 men and 1 woman, with a mean age of 33.9 years. Average postoperative follow-up was 8 months. We graded results according to the Mayo modified wrist score. We rated 2 of the 10 patients (20%) as &quot;excellent,&quot; 3 (30%) as &quot;good,&quot; and 5 (50%) as &quot;fair.&quot; The 5 patients who were rated as &quot;fair&quot; returned to regular jobs or had restricted employment. Based on this small sample, we recommend that this technique be considered an alternative method for TFCC repair.",The Journal of hand surgery,22624787,2012
Management of soft-tissue injuries in distal radius fractures.,"Distal radius fractures account for approximately 15% of all fractures in adults, and are the most common fractures seen in the emergency department. Soft-tissue injuries associated with distal radius fractures may influence strategies for the acute management of the fracture, but also may be a source of persisting pain and/or disability despite fracture healing. This article describes soft-tissue injuries and considerations for treatment associated with distal radius fractures, including injuries to the skin, tendon and muscle, ligaments, the triangular fibrocartilage complex, neurovascular structures, and related conditions such as compartment syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome.",Hand clinics,22554666,2012
Diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance arthrography for triangular fibrocartilaginous complex injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) tears are common sources of ulnar-sided wrist pain and resultant functional disability. Diagnosis is based on the history and clinical examination as well as radiographic evidence of a TFCC central perforation or a radial/ulnar tear. The purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) in the detection of TFCC injury in the adult population.METHODS: Published and unpublished literature databases were searched. Two-by-two tables were constructed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MRI or MRA investigations against arthroscopic outcomes. Pooled sensitivity and specificity values and summary receiver operating characteristic curve evaluations were performed. The methodological quality of each study was assessed with use of the QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool.RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the review, and these series included a total of 982 wrists. On meta-analysis, MRA was superior to MRI in the investigation of full-thickness TFCC tears, with a pooled sensitivity of 0.75 and a pooled specificity of 0.81 for MRI compared with 0.84 and 0.95, respectively, for MRA. MRA and MRI performed at greater field strengths were reported to have greater sensitivity and specificity than those performed at lower field strengths. There were insufficient data to assess the diagnostic test accuracy for partial-thickness TFCC tears.CONCLUSIONS: Given its acceptable diagnostic test accuracy, it is recommended that MRA, rather than MRI, be performed in when there are questions about the diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with ulnar-sided wrist pain.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Magnetic resonance imaging of triangular fibrocartilage.,"Due to their small size and complex structure, diagnosing injury of the proximal wrist ligamentous structures can be challenging. The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is an example of one such structure, for which lesions may be missed unless high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained via a standard matrix with a small field of view or high-resolution imaging matrix (small spatial scale matrix elements/large matrix size) is utilized. While there have been recent advances in increasing MRI spatial resolution, attempts at improved visualization by isolated increase in the spatial resolution will be ineffective if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the images obtained is low. Additionally, high contrast resolution is important to facilitate a more precise visualization of these structures and their pathology. Thus, a balance of the three important imaging factor qualifications of high spatial resolution, high SNR, and high contrast resolution must be struck for optimized TFCC and wrist imaging. The goal of this article, then, is to elucidate the theory and techniques of effective high-resolution imaging of the proximal ligamentous structures of the wrist, balancing SNR and high contrast resolution constraints, and focusing on imaging of the TFCC as a prototypical example.",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,22434698,2012
Arthroscopic debridement of intercarpal ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"INTRODUCTION: Wrist arthroscopy has evolved since its inception to become an essential diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the management of various wrist disorders. Our study aimed to examine the outcomes of arthroscopic debridement in the treatment of scapholunate (SL), lunotriquetral (LT) and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 68 consecutive wrist arthroscopies performed at our institution between January 2000 and July 2005. All the patients complained of wrist pain, which often interfered with their daily activities, work or sports. A standard arthroscopic technique was employed in all. Any intercarpal ligament or TFCC tears found were debrided.RESULTS: There were 42 patients with TFCC tears, 58 with SL tears and 49 with LT tears. At a mean follow-up time of 16.6 months, 85.3% of the patients reported an improvement in symptoms and 27.9% had improved range of motion. Grip strength improved by 11.8%. All except two patients returned to their original activities. Outcome following arthroscopic debridement was determined using the Mayo Modified Wrist Score. Based on the postoperative wrist scores of 47 patients, 24 were rated excellent, 17 good, four fair and two poor. By comparing the pre- and postoperative wrist scores of 31 patients, we were able to demonstrate significant improvement in patients who underwent wrist arthroscopies.CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that there is a definite role for arthroscopic debridement in the management of SL, LT and TFCC tears.",Singapore medical journal,22434293,2012
Patterns of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury associated with severely dorsally displaced extra-articular distal radius fractures.,"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to examine triangular fibrocartilage (TFCC) injury patterns associated with unstable, extra-articular dorsally displaced distal radius fractures.METHODS: Twenty adult patients with an Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO), type A2 or A3, distal radius fracture with an initial dorsal angulation greater than 20° were included. Nine had a tip fracture (distal to the base) of the ulnar styloid and 11 had no such fracture. They were all openly explored from an ulnopalmar approach and TFCC injuries were documented. Eleven patients also underwent arthroscopy and intra-articular pathology was recorded.RESULTS: All patients had TFCC lesions of varying severity, having an extensor carpi ulnaris subsheath avulsion in common. Eighteen out of 20 also displayed deep foveal radioulnar ligament lesions, with decreasingly dorsal fibres remaining. The extent of this foveal injury could not be appreciated by radiocarpal arthroscopy.CONCLUSIONS: Severe displacement of an extra-articular radius fracture suggests an ulnar-sided ligament injury to the TFCC. The observed lesions concur with findings in a previous cadaver study. The lesions follow a distinct pattern affecting both radioulnar as well as ulnocarpal stabilisers.",Injury,22424702,2012
[Clinical retrospective evaluation of the arthroscopic treatments of the triangular fibrocartilage complex of the wrist].,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is the retrospective clinical evaluation of the arthroscopic treatments for triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.METHODS: Between 2003 and 2010, 76 patients with a traumatic lesion (Palmer type 1) and 25 patients with a degenerative lesion (Palmer type 2) of the triangular fibrocartilage complex underwent wrist arthroscopy. Clinical evaluations were based on the Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), on a compared measurement of the grip force and on a measurement of the different ranges of motion. We also made a subjective evaluation of the benefit brought by arthroscopy and a retrospective evaluation of the pre and postoperative pain.RESULTS: Mean MMWS was 86.3 for traumatic lesions and 83 for degenerative lesions. Mean grip force was 84.8 (Palmer type 1) and 84.2 (Palmer type 2) compared to the controlateral side. Mean ranges of flexion-extension, prosupination and radioulnar motions were 135°, 164° and 56° respectively for traumatic lesions and 130°, 156° and 54° respectively for degenerative lesions. Ninety-four percent of the operated patients reported an improvement of the symptomatology with better results for type 1 (98.7%) compared to type 2 (80%). We noted a clear diminution of the postoperative pain compared to the preoperative's one with frequently some mild persistent pain however.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic treatments of the triangular fibrocartilage complex seem to be effective with an improvement of the symptomatology.",Chirurgie de la main,22381264,2012
Arthroscopic treatment of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex tears with the deep fibers intact.,"PURPOSE: We describe a variant of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears in which the superficial fibers attaching to the ulnar capsule are torn, with preservation of deep fibers inserting on the fovea. We present the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings and the results of arthroscopic repair in patients with this injury.METHODS: Twenty-nine wrists were treated arthroscopically for peripheral TFCC tears with outside-in suture repair of the TFCC to the ulnar capsule. A retrospective review of all cases was performed to assess the physical examination, magnetic resonance imaging, and intraoperative findings. Patients were evaluated at greater than 1 year with range of motion, grip strength, standard outcome measures, and a survey assessing return to work and sports.RESULTS: Before surgery, all patients had complaints of ulnar-sided wrist pain with a stable distal radioulnar joint on examination. Twenty-six wrists (90%) were available for follow-up at a mean of 31 months. There was one repeat surgery, a re-tear that required revision TFCC repair. The preoperative visual analog scale and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores improved from 5 and 38 to 1 and 9, respectively, at final follow-up. Side-to-side comparisons demonstrated no measurable loss in motion or grip strength. There were no cases of distal radioulnar joint instability at final follow-up. Of 11 high-level athletes in the total cohort, 7 (64%) were able to return to sports, including all of those in racquet sports; however, athletes who bore weight through their hands were unable to return to their sporting activity.CONCLUSIONS: Tears of the TFCC superficial fibers with the deep fibers intact present with ulnar-sided wrist pain but without distal radioulnar joint instability. The results of outside-in repair of the articular disk back to the ulnar capsule demonstrated improvement in pain and function with no measurable objective losses. Return to sport was variable and appeared worse for those who bear weight through the hands.",The Journal of hand surgery,22305741,2012
Arthroscopic knotless peripheral triangular fibrocartilage repair.,"Peripheral tears to the articular disk of the triangular fibrocartilage complex are fairly common. Patients complain of ulnar-sided wrist pain with ulnar deviation and forearmrotation along the prestyloid recess. The peripheral tears of the articular disk are amenable to arthroscopic repair due to its blood supply. All-arthroscopic knotless repair of peripheral ulnar-sided tears of the articular disk has several advantages. This technique allows for repair of the superficial and deep layers of the articular disk directly down to bone.

Intrafocal pin plate fixation of distal ulna fractures associated with distal radius fractures.,"Subcapital ulnar fractures in association with distal radius fractures in elderly patients increase instability and pose a treatment challenge. Fixation of the ulnar fracture with traditional implants is difficult due to the subcutaneous location, comminution, and osteoporosis. We describe an intrafocal pin plate that provides fixation by a locking plate on the distal ulna and intramedullary fixation within the shaft. The low profile and percutaneous technique make this device a useful alternative for treatment of subcapital ulna fractures in the elderly.",The Journal of hand surgery,22192166,2011
Wrist arthroscopy in children and adolescents: a single surgeon experience of thirty-four cases.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report our experience of wrist arthroscopy in children and adolescents with chronic wrist pain in a retrospective single surgeon series. Therefore, technical differences or obstacles compared to standard wrist arthroscopy in adults, and complications were highlighted.METHODS: A retrospective data review of all patients undergoing wrist arthroscopy between 2002 and 2011 was performed. The basic inclusion criteria was chronic, therapy refractory wrist pain for more than three months in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger. In total, 34 arthroscopies in 27 girls and six boys were reviewed. The mean age at time of arthroscopic exploration was 14.6 years (range, 9.8-17.9 years).RESULTS: A total of 28 wrists showed a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear (82.4%). In 26 of 34 (76.5%) inspected wrist joints additional pathologies besides TFCC tears were documented. As a consequence, 14 arthroscopic TFCC resections, two arthroscopic TFCC repairs and seven open resection arthroplasties were performed. Other concomitant procedures (e.g., ulna shortening) were performed in 25 patients (26 wrists) because of predisposing malformations. No intraoperative or postoperative complications related to the arthroscopies were observed. No relevant technical differences to wrist arthroscopy in adults were experienced apart from cases of major anatomical malformations.CONCLUSIONS: Wrist arthroscopy has been shown to be a safe procedure to detect and treat paediatric wrist disorders. Nevertheless, we believe that this procedure should only be carried out by well-trained, experienced hand surgeons.",International orthopaedics,22159549,2011
Prevalence of triangular fibrocartilage complex abnormalities on MRI scans of asymptomatic wrists.,"PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the wrist is increasingly used in the diagnosis of ulnar-sided wrist pain; however, its efficacy in this setting still needs clarification. The purposes of this study were to investigate the prevalence of abnormal MRI findings in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in asymptomatic volunteers and to provide the clinician with comparative data when interpreting MRI results.METHODS: A total of 103 asymptomatic volunteers underwent imaging of the wrist using a 1.9-T MR scanner and a send-receive birdcage quadrature coil. The images were evaluated by 3 independent interpreters, 2 musculoskeletal radiologists, and 1 orthopedic hand surgeon. We noted details regarding the TFCC morphology and the presence, characteristics, and location of any TFCC abnormality.RESULTS: The TFCC was considered abnormal in 39 wrists. The scans were abnormal in 31 subjects younger than 50 years of age, in 5 subjects 50 to 59 years of age, and in all subjects older than 60 years of age (3 subjects). We diagnosed a complete tear of the TFCC in 23 wrists. An increase in age was correlated with an abnormal TFCC (r(pb) = 0.23; P = .016).CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of incidental TFCC findings in MRI scans of asymptomatic subjects is high. The presence of an abnormal TFCC on MRI may be of questionable clinical meaning, because there is a high incidence of TFCC abnormalities in asymptomatic subjects, particularly those over the age of 50. Imaging results must be viewed in the context of the clinical history and physical examination.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic III.",The Journal of hand surgery,22129657,2011
Provocative wrist tests and MRI are of limited diagnostic value for suspected wrist ligament injuries: a cross-sectional study.,"QUESTION: What is the diagnostic value of provocative wrist tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for suspected wrist ligament injuries?DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.PARTICIPANTS: 105 people presenting to hand clinics with wrist pain and suspected wrist ligament injuries were evaluated prospectively.OUTCOME MEASURES: The integrity of wrist ligaments was tested with seven provocative tests. The results were compared to the reference standard of arthroscopy. In a subgroup of 55 participants, MRI findings were also compared to arthroscopy. The provocative tests were the scaphoid shift test (SS test), lunotriquetral test (LT test), midcarpal test (MC test), distal radioulnar joint test (DRUJ test), triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) stress test (TFCC test), TFCC stress test with compression (TFCC comp test), and the gripping rotatory impaction test (GRIT).RESULTS: Most provocative tests and MRI findings were of little or no value for diagnosing wrist ligament injuries. Exceptions were the SS test (+ve LR 2.88 and -ve LR 0.28), MC test (+ve LR 2.67) and DRUJ test (-ve LR 0.30), all of which were of mild diagnostic usefulness. MRI was moderately useful for diagnosing TFCC injuries (+ve LR 5.56, -ve LR 0.15), and was mildly useful for diagnosing scapholunate (SL) ligament injuries (+ve LR 4.17, -ve LR 0.32) and lunate cartilage damage (+ve LR 3.67, -ve LR 0.33). Adding MRI to provocative tests improved the accuracy of diagnosis of TFCC injuries slightly (by 13%) and lunate cartilage damage (by 8%).CONCLUSION: Provocative wrist tests of SL ligament injuries and midcarpal ligament injuries are mildly useful for diagnosing wrist injuries. MRI diagnostic findings of SL ligament injuries, lunate cartilage damage, and TFCC are mildly to moderately useful. MRI slightly improves the diagnosis of TFCC injury and lunate cartilage damage compared to provocative tests alone.",Journal of physiotherapy,22093123,2011
Persistent ulnar-sided wrist pain after treatment of triquetral dorsal chip fracture: six cases related to triangular fibrocartilage complex injury.,"INTRODUCTION: Persistent ulnar-sided wrist pain after treatment of triquetral dorsal chip fracture even after union is a matter of concern. There could be various reasons for this persistent pain like arthritis, instability, fractures and non-union. We correlate our findings of physical examination and wrist arthroscopy as triangular fibrocartilage complex injury to be one of the causes of this persistent pain.PATIENTS: Six subjects who had persistent ulnocarpal joint pain and tenderness after triquetral dorsal chip fracture, despite 2 months of conservative treatment, were subjected to physical tests. If the physical examination yields positive results, then magnetic resonance imaging followed by arthroscopic treatment was performed. The six patients were then evaluated using the visual analogue scale, the Mayo modified wrist score, and the grip strength test.RESULTS: Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury was observed in all six cases and partial TFCC resection and synovectomy were performed. Analysis of the visual analogue scale, Mayo modified wrist score, and grip strength test data revealed statistically significant improvements (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: In addition to several causes reported in the published literature, TFCC injury can be a cause of persistent ulnar pain after treatment of triquetral dorsal chip fracture. Arthroscopic partial TFCC resection can be considered to be a suitable treatment for such cases.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,22072191,2011
Cone-beam computed tomography arthrography: an innovative modality for the evaluation of wrist ligament and cartilage injuries.,"PURPOSE: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become an important modality in dento-facial imaging but remains poorly used in the exploration of the musculoskeletal system. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the performance and radiation exposure of CBCT arthrography in the evaluation of ligament and cartilage injuries in cadaveric wrists, with gross pathology findings as the standard of reference.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conventional arthrography was performed under fluoroscopic guidance on 10 cadaveric wrists, followed by MDCT acquisition and CBCT acquisition. CBCT arthrography and MDCT arthrography images were independently analyzed by two musculoskeletal radiologists working independently and then in consensus. The following items were observed: scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments, triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) (tear, integrity), and proximal carpal row cartilage (chondral tears). Wrists were dissected and served as the standard of reference for comparisons. Interobserver agreement, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were determined. Radiation dose (CTDI) of both modalities was recorded.RESULTS: CBCT arthrography provides equivalent results to MDCT arthrography in the evaluation of ligaments and cartilage with sensitivity and specificity between 82 and 100%, and interobserver agreement between 0.83 and 0.97. However, radiation dose was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) for CBCT arthrography than for MDCT arthrography with a mean CTDI of 2.1 mGy (range 1.7-2.2) versus a mean of 15.1 mGy (range 14.7-16.1).CONCLUSION: CBCT arthrography appears to be an innovative alternative to MDCT arthrography of the wrist as it allows an accurate and low radiation dose evaluation of ligaments and cartilage.",Skeletal radiology,22064983,2011
Subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint as a predictor of foveal triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"PURPOSE: The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) with its ulnar foveal attachment is the primary stabilizer of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). The purpose of this study was to describe a technique for measuring the degree of subluxation of the DRUJ in wrist magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations to predict tears involving the foveal attachment of the TFCC.METHODS: We measured DRUJ geometry in wrist MRI examinations of 34 patients who were found to have foveal TFCC tears at surgery. We compared the results with DRUJ geometry in 11 asymptomatic controls. Subluxation of the ulnar head was assessed using transaxial MRI images obtained at the level of the DRUJ with the wrist in pronation. We quantified subluxation with a line spanning the sigmoid notch of the radius and a perpendicular line through the center of curvature of the articulating surface of the ulna. We calculated the ratio of the lengths of the dorsal and volar segments and normalized it to the center of the sigmoid notch.RESULTS: A total of 34 patients with intraoperatively confirmed tears of the foveal attachment of the TFCC had a mean dorsal ulnar subluxation measurement of 16% ± 4%, whereas the 11 controls had a mean subluxation measurement of 5% ± 4%.CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the hypothesis that subluxation of the ulnar head relative to the sigmoid notch of the radius, as assessed by MRI with the wrist in pronation, is a predictor of tears of the foveal attachment of the TFCC.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic II.",The Journal of hand surgery,22036278,2011
Predictors of distal radioulnar joint instability in distal radius fractures.,"PURPOSE: A tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is the most frequent soft tissue injury associated with fractures of the distal radius, and repair of the deep ligamentous portion of the TFCC is considered when the tear contributes to instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to identify predictors of DRUJ instability accompanying unstable distal radius fractures.METHODS: Between 2002 and 2007, we prospectively treated 163 consecutive patients with unstable distal radius fractures with the volar locking plating system. Complete radioulnar ligament tears representing DRUJ instability were present in 11 of 163 distal radius fractures. We tested univariate associations between DRUJ instability and potential predictors and conducted multivariate analysis to establish independent predictors of instability. We applied receiver operating characteristics curves within the significant risk factors to determine threshold values.RESULTS: In univariate analyses, only the radial and sagittal translation ratios of the fracture site were significant predictors of DRUJ instability. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that the radial translation ratio, which corresponds to a normalized DRUJ gap, was a significant risk factor. According to the receiver operating characteristics curve for the radial translation ratio, the area under the curve was 0.89. A cutoff value of 15% for the radial translation ratio showed the highest diagnostic accuracy rate.CONCLUSIONS: A radiographic finding of a normalized DRUJ gap on posteroanterior views was the most important predictor to identify DRUJ instability accompanying unstable distal radius fractures. The relative risk of instability increases by 50% when the ratio of DRUJ widening increases by 1%.",The Journal of hand surgery,22036131,2011
[Chronic ulnar wrist pain in adults: diagnosis and treatment principles].,"Adult patients with chronic ulnar wrist pain often seek medical advice. There are a number of diagnoses for chronic ulnar-sided wrist pain. A sound diagnostic strategy is therefore of paramount importance. Patient's history, clinical examination and high quality standard radiographs are the most important part of this strategy. Sophisticated investigations should only be performed to focus on solid clinical hypotheses. The palmar and dorsal aetiologies of ulnar wrist pain are considered as well as their treatment principles.",Chirurgie de la main,22030264,2011
[Arthroscopic treatment for post-traumatic chronic wrist pain].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effects of arthroscopy for post-traumatic chronic wrist pain.METHODS: From February 2007 to June 2010, 12 patients with post-traumatic chronic wrist pain treated with arthroscopy were reviewed. Among the patients, 9 patients were male and 3 patients were female, ranging in age from 19 to 47 years, with a mean of 35.6 years. After physical examinations or MR abnormal findings, all the patients underwent wrist arthroscopic examination and treatment. Eight patients with tear in the central area of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) underwent endoscopic partial resection. Two patients with relaxation of inter-carpal ligament after injury underwent radiofrequency shrinkage. One patient with distal radioulnar joint instability was treated with Kirschner fixation through distal radius and ulna in the neutral forearm rotation after clean-up of wrist joint, and also fixed with long arm cast immobilization for 6 weeks. One patient with ulnar impaction syndrome was treated with wrist clean, border modeling of triangular cartilage plate, partial resection of distal ulna.RESULTS: All the patients were followed up with an average duration of 10 months. Modified Mayo wrist score were evaluated from preoperative mean of (51.67 +/- 15.27) ( 25 to 75 scores) to postoperative mean of (77.92 +/- 10.54) (65 to 95 scores). Eleven patients recovered to normal work.CONCLUSION: Arthroscopy is an effective method for patients with post-traumatic chronic wrist pain which can diagnosis and cure the injuries under arthroscopy.",Zhongguo gu shang = China journal of orthopaedics and traumatology,22007577,2011
Galeazzi fracture.,"Galeazzi fracture is a fracture of the radial diaphysis with disruption at the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Typically, the mechanism of injury is forceful axial loading and torsion of the forearm. Diagnosis is established on radiographic evaluation. Underdiagnosis is common because disruption of the ligamentous restraints of the DRUJ may be overlooked. Nonsurgical management with anatomic reduction and immobilization in a long-arm cast has been successful in children. In adults, nonsurgical treatment typically fails because of deforming forces acting on the distal radius and DRUJ. Open reduction and internal fixation is the preferred surgical option. Anatomic reduction and rigid fixation should be followed by intraoperative assessment of the DRUJ. Further intraoperative interventions are based on the reducibility and postreduction stability of the DRUJ. Misdiagnosis or inadequate management of Galeazzi fracture may result in disabling complications, such as DRUJ instability, malunion, limited forearm range of motion, chronic wrist pain, and osteoarthritis.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,21980027,2011
Bucket-handle tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex: case report of a complex peripheral injury with separation of the distal radioulnar ligaments from the articular disc.,"Palmer previously proposed a classification system of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries that proved to be useful in directing clinical management. However, dorsal peripheral tears (variants of class 1C) were not described and have rarely been reported in the literature since. We herewith present a rare case of bucket-handle tear of the TFCC. To our knowledge, this is the first case demonstrating partial separation of both the palmar and dorsal distal radioulnar ligaments (DRULs) from the articular disc. The particular wrist magnetic resonance (MR) arthrographic findings of this unusual complex peripheral TFCC tear (a variant of both class 1B and 1C) were nicely appreciated upon sagittal reformatted images.",Skeletal radiology,21922201,2011
A comparison of ulnar shortening osteotomy alone versus combined arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex debridement and ulnar shortening osteotomy for ulnar impaction syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: This study compared the results of patients treated for ulnar impaction syndrome using an ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO) alone with those treated with combined arthroscopic debridement and USO.METHODS: The results of 27 wrists were reviewed retrospectively. They were divided into three groups: group A (USO alone, 10 cases), group B (combined arthroscopic debridement and USO, 9 cases), and group C (arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex [TFCC] debridement alone, 8 cases). The wrist function was evaluated using the modified Mayo wrist score, disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score and Chun and Palmer grading system.RESULTS: The modified Mayo wrist score in groups A, B, and C was 74.5 ± 8.9, 73.9 ± 11.6, and 61.3 ± 10.2, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). The DASH score in groups A, B, and C was 15.6 ± 11.8, 19.3 ± 11.9, and 33.2 ± 8.5, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). The average Chun and Palmer grading score in groups A and B was 85.7 ± 8.9 and 84.7 ± 6.7, respectively. The difference in the Mayo wrist score, DASH score and Chun and Palmer grading score between group A and B was not significant (p &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Both USO alone and combined arthroscopic TFCC debridement with USO improved the wrist function and reduced the level of pain in the patients treated for ulnar impaction syndrome. USO alone may be the preferred method of treatment in patients if the torn flap of TFCC is not unstable.",Clinics in orthopedic surgery,21909465,2011
Role of MRI in the diagnosis and management of patients with clinical scaphoid fracture.,"PURPOSE: The American College of Radiologists (ACR) recognises the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the investigation of choice in patients with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture but normal plain radiographs. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) in the UK produces no similar guidelines, as evidenced by the inconsistent management of such cases in hospitals around the UK. In discussion with our musculoskeletal radiologists, we implemented new guidelines to standardise management of our patients and now report our findings.METHODS: A consecutive series of 137 patients referred to the orthopaedic department with clinically suspected scaphoid fracture but normal series of plain radiographs were prospectively followed up over a two-year period. We implemented the use of early MRI for these patients and determined its incidence of detected scaphoid injury in addition to other occult injuries. We then prospectively examined results of these findings on patient management.RESULTS: Thirty-seven (27%) MRI examinations were normal with no evidence of a bony or soft-tissue injury. Soft-tissue injury was diagnosed in 59 patients (43.4%). Of those, 46 were triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears (33.8%) and 18 were intercarpal ligament injuries (13.2 %). Bone marrow oedema with no distinct fracture was discovered in 55 cases (40.4%). In 17 (12.5%) cases, this involved only the scaphoid. In the remainder, it also involved the other carpal bones or distal radius. Fracture(s) were diagnosed on 30 examinations (22.0%).CONCLUSIONS: MRI should be regarded as the gold standard investigation for patients in whom a scaphoid fracture is suspected clinically. It allows the diagnosis of occult bony and soft-tissue injuries that can present clinically as a scaphoid fracture; it also helps exclude patients with no fracture. We believe that there is a need to implement national guidelines for managing occult scaphoid fractures.",International orthopaedics,21898036,2011
Repair of foveal detachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex: open and arthroscopic transosseous techniques.,"Because the radioulnar ligament attaches to the ulnar fovea and base of the ulnar styloid, foveal detachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) induces severe distal radioulnar joint instability. This article describes both an arthroscopic and open repair technique to reattach the TFCC to the fovea. Both techniques reanchor the detached TFCC to the fovea. Both techniques are reliable and promising techniques in the repair of a foveal detachment of the TFCC.",Hand clinics,21871351,2011
Arthroscopic knotless peripheral ulnar-sided TFCC repair.,"Peripheral ulnar-sided tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are common injuries and are amenable to arthroscopic repair. This article describes an all-arthroscopic knotless technique for TFCC repair. This technique has the advantage of being all arthroscopic using 3 portals, has the ability to repair both the superficial and deep layers of the articular disk, repairs the articular disk directly back to bone, and does not require any suture knots that may irritate the surrounding soft tissues. The surgical technique is described in detail.",Hand clinics,21871350,2011
Foveal TFCC tear classification and treatment.,"During the last two decades, increased knowledge of functional anatomy and pathophysiology of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) have contributed to a change in surgeons' perspective toward it. The earlier concept of the TFCC as the &quot;hammock&quot; structure of the ulnar carpus has updated to the &quot;iceberg&quot; concept, whereby the much larger &quot;submerged&quot; part represents the foveal insertions of the TFCC and functions as the stabilizer of the distal radioulnar joint and the ulnar carpus, thus lending it greater functional importance. This article presents an algorithm of the treatment of traumatic peripheral TFCC tear based on clinical, radiological, and arthroscopic findings.",Hand clinics,21871349,2011
Arthroscopic evaluation of the foveal attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage.,"Anatomical and biomechanical studies have highlighted the importance of the deep attachment of the TFCC for maintaining stability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). The standard arthroscopic assessment of the TFCC does not allow one to definitively determine whether the deep fibers are indeed intact, and establishing the diagnosis of a foveal detachment remains an exacting challenge. DRUJ arthroscopy is useful to assess the foveal fibers in any patient with DRUJ instability and can aid in the surgical decision making.",Hand clinics,21871348,2011
Radial side (1D) tears.,"The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is the key structure at the wrist that facilitates the rotation of the radius and the carpus on the distal ulnar. The radial or type 1D tears of the TFCC are uncommon, but they pose a major disruption of the articular contact between the carpus and the distal ulna. The tears can heal by arthroscopically repairing the TFCC back to the radius using sutures through bone tunnels. This procedure allows patients to return to their work and sports activities with significant recovery of strength and range of motion.",Hand clinics,21871347,2011
All-arthroscopic repair of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex tears using FasT-Fix.,"Injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is a major source of ulnar-sided wrist pain that results in disability with common activities of daily living involving forearm rotation, for which operative management is indicated if conservative management fails. Past results with open repairs have been successful, but recent surgical advances have allowed the development of arthroscopic management. This article describes and reviews an all-arthroscopic technique of repair of Palmer type IB TFCC injuries with FasT-Fix suture technology (Smith and Nephew, Andover, MA, USA), which is advantageous both biomechanically and in terms of decreasing risk of morbidity.",Hand clinics,21871346,2011
Arthroscopic-assisted repair of avulsed triangular fibrocartilage complex to the fovea of the ulnar head: a 2- to 4-year follow-up study.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to conduct a follow-up evaluation of an arthroscopic reattachment technique using an avulsed deep component of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (dc-TFCC) from the fovea of the distal ulna (ulnar fovea).METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on a consecutive cohort of 12 patients who underwent arthroscopic reattachment of the avulsed dc-TFCC into the ulnar fovea over a 24-month period. The mean age was 31 years (range, 20 to 50 years). There were 6 men and 6 women. This technique anchors the avulsed portion of the dc-TFCC to the ulnar fovea by means of a repair suture passed through the created osseous tunnel from the ulnar neck to the foveal surface. Postoperative clinical and functional outcomes were quantitatively evaluated with the Modified Mayo Wrist Score. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire served to assess each patient's subjective outcome. A questionnaire regarding each patient's return to his or her previous job was also completed. Radiographic evaluation was based on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examinations.RESULTS: At the mean follow-up of 30 months, all patients had significant reduction of wrist pain. The mean Modified Mayo Wrist Score was 92.5 ± 7.5, and all patients were rated as having excellent or good clinical results. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score significantly improved from 59.5 ± 18.5 to 7.7 ± 11.9 postoperatively (P &lt; .0001). Of the 9 working patients, 7 returned to their previous work. Two patients had occasional extensor carpi ulnaris tendinitis after surgery. Magnetic resonance images at 12 weeks postoperatively showed findings indicating attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) to the fovea.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic reattachment of the avulsed TFCC to the ulnar fovea by the described technique is a valid alternative for treating avulsion of the foveal TFCC insertion.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,21868189,2011
Arthroscopic assessment of intraarticular distal radius fractures--results of minimally invasive fixation.,"BACKGROUND: For many years, wrist arthroscopy has been used to diagnose and treat soft tissue lesions and to restore anatomic articular surface alignment in intraarticular fractures. However, there are no publications providing clear and precise indications for wrist arthroscopy in distal radius fractures. The aim of the study was to analyse factors influencing the outcomes of intraarticular distal radius fracture treatment with K-wire fixation under arthroscopic guidance in AO B1 and C1 type fractures.MATERIAL AND METHOD: A group of 26 patients (27 wrists) following an arthroscopic procedure (ARTR group) was the prospective component and 27 patients (27 wrists) following a non-arthroscopic procedure (OP group) constituted the retrospective part of the trial. Both groups consisted only of patients with B1 and C1 type fractures (10 and 17, respectively) according to the AO classification.RESULTS: In the ARTR group, there was a marked (statistically significant) difference between radiologically and arthroscopically assessed displacement. This underestimation of displacement was higher in B1 than C1 type fractures (statistically significant difference). Numerous associated injuries were identified, such as carpal bone cartilage injuries (85.19%), TFCC injury (59.26%) and SL ligament injuries (40.74%). Loose bodies were detected in 66.7% of the patients. In B1 type fractures, the most common ligamentous injury was a SL ligament lesion (50%), while in C1 fractures it was a TFCC lesion (70.59%). Comparing both groups (ARTR and OP), better clinical outcomes were observed in the ARTR group (though not statistically significant), with the most marked differences noted with regard to B1 type fractures.CONCLUSIONS: In B1 and C1 type intraarticular distal radius fractures, displacement visible during arthroscopy was greater than that seen on primary radiological assessment. In B1 type fractures, the difference between radiological and arthroscopic evaluation of displacement was more marked than in C1 fractures. It means that B1 type fractures can be highly &quot;misleading&quot;, because their radiological pattern suggested little displacement, while actual displacement was more pronounced. On the basis of our results, it might be concluded that wrist arthroscopy could become a standard, routine procedure in B1 type fractures. In C1 type fractures, the method of treatment would depend on the surgeon's preferences.","Ortopedia, traumatologia, rehabilitacja",21857068,2011
Accidental section of the ulnar nerve in the wrist during arthroscopy.,Arthroscopy of the wrist is a frequently performed procedure. Its role in diagnosis and treatment is significant. The complications of arthroscopy are well known and are described in the literature. We describe a case of accidental section of the ulnar nerve during repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex during arthroscopy. The nerve section was caused by the trocar used for drainage in the 6U portal. We propose to establish the injury mechanism and describe a safe procedure for this examination.,Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,21820268,2011
Ligament reconstruction using the Fulkerson-Watson method to treat chronic isolated distal radioulnar joint instability: short-term results.,"OBJECTIVE: Isolated distal radioulnar instability may remain unrecognized during the acute period of trauma as it is difficult to diagnose, and does not become obvious until later when it has become chronic. We present early results in patients who underwent stabilization with extraarticular ligament reconstruction (Fulkerson-Watson reconstruction).METHODS: Four women and 1 man underwent surgery for chronic isolated distal radioulnar joint instability demonstrated in X-rays and magnetic resonance images. Arthroscopy revealed avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex from the point of insertion in 3 patients, and peripheral tears in 2 patients. The peripheral tears were debrided arthroscopically. All patients had an adequate sigmoid notch and therefore underwent ligament reconstruction using the Fulkerson-Watson method. Postoperative evaluations were done with MRI.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 15.5 months (range 6-26 months). Stability was achieved in all patients. The mean Quick-DASH symptom score decreased from 18.63 (15.90-22.72) to 6.81 (2.27-9.09) after surgery. A mean visual analogue score to assess pain decreased from 7.32 (6.30-8.40) to 1.88 (1.50-2.30) after surgery. Preoperative and postoperative measurements were 26° (passive 44°) and 47° (passive 65°) for active supination, 18° (passive 45°) and 49°(passive 68°) for active pronation, 20° (passive 43°) and 42° (passive 60°) for active wrist flexion,and 38° (passive 52°) and 45° (passive 59°) for active wrist extension.CONCLUSION: Surgical revision of distal radioulnar joint instability using Fulkerson-Watson reconstruction is easier than intraarticular techniques and satisfactorily re-establishes stability, provided that the sigmoid notch is adequate.",Acta orthopaedica et traumatologica turcica,21765230,2011
[Reconstruction of the distal radioulnar joint using the Herbert ulnar head prosthesis].,"OBJECTIVE: To provide painfree forearm rotation in patients with degenerative changes of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). The primary goal is to stabilize the DRUJ in patients with an unstable stump of the distal ulna following resection arthroplasty with the secondary effect of restoring painfree forearm rotation.INDICATIONS: Instability of the distal ulna following various types of resection arthroplasties. Primary or secondary osteoarthritis of the DRUJ. Replacement of an ulnar head destroyed by tumor or trauma.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Longitudinal instability of the forearm (e.g., following an Essex-Lopresti-type of injury, resection of the radial head). Inadequate soft tissue with severe ulnocarpal ligamentous insufficiency. Radial deformity (must be corrected before replacement of the ulnar head).SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: In cases of osteoarthritis of the DRUJ, dorsal exposure of the distal radioulnar joint to the depth of the 5th extensor compartment. Raising of an ulnar-based capsuloretinacular flap by sharp dissection off the ulnar neck proximally and off the dorsal part of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) distally. Osteotomy of the distal ulna corresponding to the preoperatively planned size of the prosthesis and removal of the ulnar head, while preserving the attachment of the TFCC within the capsuloretinacular flap. Reaming of the ulnar medullary canal. Insertion of a trial prosthesis. The trial prosthesis has to fit accurately into the shaft with a fluoroscopically documented ulna minus situation of minus 1-2 mm at the wrist joint level. After implanting the definite stem and ulnar head of the Herbert ulnar head prothesis (Martin Medizintechnik®, Tuttlingen, Germany), the capsuloretinacular flap is reattached to the dorsal rim of the sigmoid notch through drilling holes and under advanced tension. In patients with an unstable distal ulnar stump, the operative procedure is technically more demanding as it is more difficult to raise a sufficient capsuloretinacular flap and due to the loss of the ulnar head as an anatomic landmark.POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Long arm cast with 70° elbow flexion, 40° forearm supination, and 20° wrist extension for 2 weeks. Subsequently forearm rotation is limited at 40° in a removable ulnar gutter splint. Six weeks postoperatively unlimited active range of motion is allowed and normal activities are gradually commenced. Return to maximum stress 12 weeks postoperatively.RESULTS: Patient satisfaction is high due to an increased forearm rotation, stronger grip force, and remarkable pain relief. In most patients with an unstable distal ulnar stump following resection arthroplasty of the DRUJ, stability can be restored.",Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie,21590371,2011
Ulnar-sided wrist pain due to isolated disk tear of triangular fibrocartilage complex within the distal radioulnar joint: two case reports.,"Wrist arthroscopy has been successfully used with many modifications and improvements. However, distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) arthroscopy is still uncommon. We experienced 2 cases of ulnar-sided wrist pain due to isolated triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) disk tear within the DRUJ. DRUJ arthroscopy in these cases showed horizontal tear and fibrillation of TFCC disk without TFCC tear at the radiocarpal joint. Foveal attachment was intact in both cases. These were treated with debridement, which relieved pain after surgery and achieved good functional recovery. Although DRUJ arthroscopy is technically difficult, it is mandatory for making a diagnosis and treating ulnar-sided wrist pain.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,21548155,2011
Pathomechanisms of ulnar ligament lesions of the wrist in a cadaveric distal radius fracture model.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mechanisms of injury to ulnar-sided ligaments (stabilizing the distal radioulnar joint and the ulna to the carpus) associated with dorsally displaced distal radius fractures are poorly described. We investigated the injury patterns in a human cadaver fracture model.METHODS: Fresh frozen human cadaver arms were used. A dorsal open-wedge osteotomy was performed in the distal radius. In 8 specimens, pressure was applied to the palm with the wrist in dorsiflexion and ulnar-sided stabilizing structures subsequently severed. Dorsal angulation was measured on digitized radiographs. In 8 other specimens, the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was forced into rupture by axially loading the forearm with the wrist in dorsiflexion. The ulnar side was dissected and injuries were recorded.RESULTS: Intact ulnar soft tissues limited the dorsal angulation of the distal radius fragment to a median of 32(o) (16-34). A combination of bending and shearing of the distal radius fragment was needed to create TFCC injuries. Both palmar and dorsal injuries were observed simultaneously in 6 of 8 specimens.INTERPRETATION: A TFCC injury can be expected when dorsal angulation of a distal radius fracture exceeds 32(o). The extensor carpi ulnaris subsheath may be a functionally integral part of the TFCC. Both dorsal and palmar structures can tear simultaneously. These findings may have implications for reconstruction of ulnar sided soft tissue injuries.",Acta orthopaedica,21504313,2011
Radioulnar laxity and clinical outcome do not correlate after a distal radius fracture.,"Injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex associated with distal radius fracture may cause symptoms of ulnar instability. Assessed by a radioulnar stress test, increased laxity of the distal radioulnar joint has in two previous studies been depicted to be associated with poorer outcome. This prospective study of 40 adults investigates the correlation of this test with functional outcome as measured by DASH. No clinically significant difference was found in relation to this test at two and five years after injury. Therefore using this test alone to decide whether or not to perform an acute repair of the TFCC cannot be recommended.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",21467090,2011
The diagnostic accuracy of X-ray arthrography for triangular fibrocartilaginous complex injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy of X-ray arthrography in the detection of TFCC tear. Both published and unpublished databases were searched from their inception to August 2010. All studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of X-ray arthrography (index test) to arthroscopy (reference standard) for patients with suspected TFCC tears were included in this review. Twelve studies assessing 430 patients (430 wrists) satisfied the eligibility criteria and were included. X-ray arthrography presented with a pooled sensitivity of 76.2% and specificity of 92.5% for the detection of complete TFCC tear. The triple-compartment injection X-ray arthrography was superior to the single-compartment injection technique. To conclude, the diagnostic test accuracy of X-ray arthrography is limited. Neither the single- nor the triple-compartment injection arthrography method is acceptable, given their reported low sensitivities. Further evaluation of the diagnostic test accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Arthrography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging is therefore warranted.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",21467087,2011
All-arthroscopic repair of Palmer 1B triangular fibrocartilage complex tears using the FasT-Fix device.,"PURPOSE: The FasT-Fix device (Smith and Nephew Endoscopy, Andover, MA), initially developed for knee meniscal tears, is described for all-arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) repairs. Potential benefits of this technique are ease of use, the lack of prominent suture knots, and strength of repair. This case series evaluates the early clinical outcomes of this technique.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with TFCC Palmer type 1B injuries treated by 1 hand surgeon from 2005 to 2009. The patients' charts were reviewed for postoperative complications, range of motion, grip strength (percentage of contralateral), and return to full activity. In addition, each patient completed Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) questionnaires.RESULTS: Twelve patients had all-arthroscopic peripheral (1B) TFCC repairs using the FasT-Fix suture device. The mean follow-up period was 17.5 months (range, 11-27). Mean supination was 78° (± 14°), and mean grip strength was 64% (±16%) of the nonsurgical extremity by 3 months after surgery. All other range of motion was full. The mean QuickDASH score was 11 (±12), and the mean PRWE score was 19 (±14). Average time to full activity was 5 months. There were no surgical complications of the procedure. One patient complained of persistent ulnar-sided wrist pain 12 months after surgery and had an ulnar shortening osteotomy. Arthroscopy at the time of the osteotomy revealed that the TFCC was stable.CONCLUSIONS: At mean 1-year follow-up, 11 out of 12 patients achieved excellent subjective outcomes based on QuickDASH and PRWE questionnaires. Although range of motion and grip strength were slightly decreased compared to prior case series reports, the short-term results indicate that the FasT-Fix all-arthroscopic, all-inside technique is a safe and effective technique for repair of Palmer type 1B TFCC tears.",The Journal of hand surgery,21458928,2011
Nerve fiber staining investigations in traumatic and degenerative disc lesions of the wrist.,"PURPOSE: Traumatic and degenerative disc lesions cause ulnar-sided wrist pain. To date, anatomical investigations of cadaver triangular fibrocartilage discs examining the innervation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex have found no evidence of nerve fibers in the healthy disc. In this study, we immunohistologically investigated biopsies from patients with either central traumatic or degenerative disc lesions, to determine the existence of nerve fibers. We hypothesized that an ingrowth of nerve fibers causes ulnar-sided wrist pain associated with traumatic and degenerative disc lesions.METHODS: We included 32 patients with a traumatic Palmer 1A lesion and 17 patients with a degenerative Palmer 2C lesion in the study. We obtained a biopsy of each patient and stained the specimen with protein gene product 9.5 for nerve fiber detection.RESULTS: There were no nerve fibers in either traumatic or degenerative disc lesions. In addition, the marginal areas of the biopsies showed no evidence of nerve fibers.CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic and degenerative disc lesions show no ingrowth of nerve fibers.",The Journal of hand surgery,21435801,2011
[Treatment of triangular fibrocartilage complex tear under wrist arthroscopy].,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the treatment and effects of wrist arthroscopy in tear of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).METHODS: Between January 2006 and December 2008, 16 patients with tear of TFCC were treated. Of 16 patients, 11 were male and 5 were female with an average age of 32.5 years (range, 25-51 years). Injury was caused by sprain in 12 cases, and by falling in 4 cases. The locations were the left side in 10 cases and the right side in 6 cases. The mean injury duration was 3 months to 6 years and 2 months. The main clinical symptoms included wrist powerlessness and ulnar-sided wrist pain which was aggravated with clench fist and lifting heavy things. The results of the ulnar-sided wrist stress test were positive in 14 cases and negative in 2 cases. The preoperative values of wrist range of motion (ROM) were (45.58 +/- 5.18) degrees at volar flexion, (41.22 +/- 3.83) degrees at dorsal extension, (17.82 +/- 2.48) degrees at radial deviation, (21.35 +/- 4.61) degrees at ulnar deviation, (69.85 +/- 8.36) degrees at pronation, and (70.13 +/- 6.34) degrees at supination. According to Palmer standard, 10 cases of IA were treated with debridement; 3 cases of IB with suture and 1 of them failed and was partially excised; 2 cases of IC with debridement on triangular fibrocartilage disc, ulnolunate ligament, and ulnotriguetrum ligament; and 1 case of ID with trimming plastic operation.RESULTS: All incisions healed by first intention, and no complications of joint infection or neurovascular injury was found. All patients were followed up 14-38 months (mean, 18.5 months). Fifteen patients were restored to normal life and work without ulnar-sided wrist pain. One patient had no pain, but he had wrist powerless. The values of ROM at last follow-up were (50.16 +/- 6.21) degrees at volar flexion, (45.37 +/- 4.65) degrees at dorsal extension, (18.95 +/- 3.56) degrees at radial deviation, (26.28 +/- 5.09) degrees at ulnar deviation, (78.87 +/- 7.69) degrees at pronation, and (76.46 +/- 8.31) degrees at supination; showing significant differences when compared with preoperative values (P &lt; 0.05). According to Green-O'Brien standard, the results were excellent in 9 cases, good in 6 cases, fair in 1 case, and the excellent and good rate was 93.75%.CONCLUSION: The wrist arthroscopy not only can definitely diagnose tear of TFCC, but also is useful for treatment. In addition, the incision is small and the function is easy to recover, and the occurrence of chronic ulnar-sided wrist pain can be effectively avoided.",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,21351599,2011
Pitfalls that may mimic injuries of the triangular fibrocartilage and proximal intrinsic wrist ligaments at MR imaging.,"Diagnosis of injuries to the ligamentous structures of the wrist can be a challenge, particularly when there is involvement of the small, complex structures of the proximal wrist. Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, especially in spatial and contrast resolution, have facilitated more precise visualization of these structures. However, there are a number of pitfalls that may cause difficulty in diagnosis of injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), lunotriquetral ligament, and scapholunate ligament. Use of inappropriate MR imaging sequences and MR imaging artifacts may decrease the accuracy of diagnosis of injuries to the TFCC and wrist ligaments, whereas variant anatomy of the proximal wrist structures may mimic disease of the TFCC and wrist ligaments. Knowledge of the detailed anatomy of the wrist, as well as variant patterns of structure morphology and signal intensity, can help differentiate actual disease from normal or variant appearances at assessment with MR imaging.","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",21257933,2011
Carpal contusions in an elite platform diver.,"Wrist and hand injuries are common in elite divers, as all correctly performed dives end with a head first entry into the water with the hands extended above the head. This case presentation was an Olympic level diver with 3 months of persistent dorsal wrist pain. MRI findings showed contiguous contusions to the lunate, capitate, hamate and distal radius and also a peripheral tear of the ulnar attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). The repeated dorsiflexion stress of entry into the water likely caused these injuries. Although the authors had suspected a TFCC injury and did find an isolated ulnar-sided peripheral tear, the complicating carpal contusions led us to choose a conservative treatment plan, which was the only intervention the patient ultimately required.",BMJ case reports,22707598,2011
TFCC reattachment after traumatic DRUJ instability: a simple alternative to arthroscopic management.,"With current trends favoring open reduction with internal fixation for distal radius fractures, distal radius-ulnar joint instabilities that were once clinically silent as a result of prolonged immobilization are now being recognized as a significant cause of morbidity. Arthroscopic management has proven to be both an effective and technically challenging treatment for triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears. TFCC reattachment offers a safe, reproducible means of managing acute posttraumatic distal radioulnar join (DRUJ) instability after distal radius volar plating. With this technique, 30 patients at an average of 43 months were examined for continued DRUJ instability, range of motion, and radiographic evaluation for radius union, posttraumatic DRUJ arthritis, and hardware failure. Postoperative Gartland scores showed 88.6% excellent, 5.7% good, and 5.7% fair results. We conclude TFCC reattachment is a safe and effective alternative for treatment of acute DRUJ instability after open reduction with internal fixation of the distal radius, especially when equipment or experience does not support arthroscopic treatment.",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,21107219,2010
Interosseous membrane reconstruction for forearm longitudinal instability.,Forearm longitudinal instability results from an axial load to the forearm with fracture or dislocation of the radial head and disruption of the interosseous membrane and that of the distal radioulnar joint. Patients may present in the acute or chronic setting with radioulnar instability as manifested by persistent or new forearm discomfort and wrist and elbow pain. Reconstruction of the interosseous membrane has been described to restore longitudinal forearm stability. We describe reconstruction of the central band of the interosseous membrane with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. This procedure may be carried out in conjunction with radial head fixation or replacement and TFCC repair in the acute setting or ulnar shortening osteotomy in late presenting cases.,Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,21107218,2010
US of the intrinsic and extrinsic wrist ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex--normal anatomy and imaging technique.,"Injuries of the intrinsic and extrinsic wrist ligaments can lead to chronic wrist pain and carpal instability, while injuries of the triangular fibrocartilage complex are a frequent cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Currently, magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography is the preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of these structures, but good results can also achieved with MR imaging without preceding arthrography and computed tomographic (CT) arthrography. Promising results have been published on ultrasonography (US) and sonoarthrography of the intrinsic wrist ligaments and the triangular fibrocartilage complex and on US of the majority of extrinsic wrist ligaments. Visualization of these structures can be achieved by using high-frequency linear transducers. US has the advantages of MR imaging and MR arthrography: lower cost, no known contraindication for imaging, and real-time technique with possible dynamic evaluation. This technique does not require imaging guided intraarticular injection of contrast medium prior to MR arthrography or CT arthrography and does not use ionizing radiation; however, US is operator dependent, which can be compensated for by using standardized imaging techniques.

The rate of triangular fibrocartilage injuries requiring surgical intervention.,"Triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries are one of the most common causes of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Although pain and discomfort may improve with simple immobilization for a short period of time, a significant number of patients eventually require surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of surgical intervention on patients with a clinical diagnosis of a triangular fibrocartilage complex injury. A retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients with ulnar-sided wrist pain identified with the appropriate ICD-9 code from September 2005 to September 2007. All patients were evaluated and treated by a board-certified, fellowship-trained hand surgeon. Any patients with associated pathology were excluded from the study. All patients were initially treated with a minimum of 4 weeks of either a volar wrist splint worn all the time or a short-arm cast. Magnetic resonance images were obtained on patients without symptomatic relief, and in these cases, surgical arthroscopy was performed. Of the 84 patients identified, 36 patients required surgical intervention. All 36 patients had evidence of triangular fibrocartilage complex injury during arthroscopy. All patients had symptomatic improvement postoperatively. The use of short-arm cast versus a splint did not affect the rate of surgical intervention (P=.38). Among the patients with clinical diagnosis of triangular fibrocartilage complex injury, the rate of surgical intervention required after a minimum 4 weeks of immobilization was 43%. The use of a short-arm cast or volar wrist splint did not affect the rate of surgical intervention.",Orthopedics,21053893,2010
Ulnar impaction.,"Ulnar impaction syndrome is a common source of ulnar-sided wrist pain. It is a degenerative condition that occurs secondary to excessive load across the ulnocarpal joint, resulting in a spectrum of pathologic changes and symptoms. It may occur in any wrist but is usually associated with positive ulnar variance, whether congenital or acquired. The diagnosis of ulnar impaction syndrome is made by clinical examination and is supported by radiographic studies. Surgery is indicated if nonoperative treatment fails. Although a number of alternatives exist, the 2 primary surgical options are ulnar-shortening osteotomy or partial resection of the distal dome of the ulna (wafer procedure). This article discusses the etiology of ulnar impaction syndrome, and its diagnosis and treatment.",Hand clinics,20951904,2010
Longitudinal split tears of the ulnotriquetral ligament.,"Unlike tears of the peripheral triangular fibrocartilage or avulsions of the distal radioulnar ligaments, longitudinal split tears of the ulnotriquetral (UT) ligament do not cause any instability to the distal radioulnar joint or the ulnocarpal articulation. It is mainly a pain syndrome that can be incapacitating. However, because the UT ligament arises from the palmar radioulnar ligament of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), it is by definition, an injury of the TFCC. The purpose of this article is to describe the cause of chronic ulnar wrist pain arising from a longitudinal split tear of the UT ligament.",Hand clinics,20951899,2010
Arthroscopic and open repair of the TFCC.,"Injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex is the most common cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain. This functionally related complex of anatomic structures can be a source of pain secondary to acute injury or chronic degeneration. Strategies for the treatment of these injuries involve determining the anatomic location of the tear, the presence of associated distal radioulnar joint instability, and the presence of associated degenerative changes. Surgical management with open and arthroscopic techniques have been described, both with successful results.",Hand clinics,20951898,2010
Open repair of foveal avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and comparison by types of injury mechanism.,"PURPOSE: Little attention has been paid to injury mechanisms of foveal avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the mechanism of injury is associated with different anatomic disruptions as well as different preoperative clinical symptoms. We also evaluated the clinical results of an open repair method for foveal avulsion according to the mechanism of injury.METHODS: Fifteen patients with a traumatic foveal TFCC avulsion were treated with an open repair technique. The injury mechanism was forced wrist extension in 10 patients (group E) and forced forearm rotation in 5 patients (group R). All patients in group E and 3 in group R showed positive fovea signs. Surgical and clinical findings were compared according to the 2 types of injury mechanism.RESULTS: Foveal insertions of TFCC were found in surgery to be disrupted in all 15 patients. In addition, disruption of the dorsal styloid insertions of the radioulnar ligament showed a significantly greater association with group R than with group E. Clinical results showed significant postoperative improvement but were marginally different between the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: The most common mechanism of foveal TFCC avulsions is forced wrist extension, an injury that commonly shows positive fovea signs and leaves the dorsal styloid insertion of the radioulnar ligament intact. Forced forearm rotation is the second most common injury mechanism that is more frequently associated with disruption of the dorsal styloid insertion.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,20934815,2010
Management of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex tears in the ulnar positive patient: arthroscopic repair versus ulnar shortening osteotomy.,"PURPOSE: One pattern of injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is a traumatic peripheral tear located at the ulnar end of the TFCC. Since 1989, this specific injury has been classified as a Palmer type 1B lesion. Various treatment options have been described for 1B injuries, yet when there is coexistent ulnar positive variance, it can make the choice of treatment difficult. The purpose of this article is to help the surgeon decide how to treat type 1B lesions in ulnar positive patients by directly comparing arthroscopic repair (repair) to ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO). The null hypothesis was that repair and USO would provide equivalent postoperative improvement with regard to motion; Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score; visual analog scale (VAS) score; and grip strength.METHODS: We tested our hypothesis by retrospectively reviewing prospectively collected data from 51 patients treated surgically between 2000 and 2006 with type 1B tears in the setting of ulnar positive variance. Of these 51 patients, 27 were treated with arthroscopic repair and 24 with USO. All patients were evaluated before surgery as well as at final follow-up for active range of motion measurements, grip strength, DASH score, and VAS score. Radiographs were taken of all patients before surgery to confirm the presence of ulnar positive variance, and after surgery in the USO group to evaluate for bony union.RESULTS: At the final follow-up, we found no statistically significant difference between the repair and USO groups with regard to flexion, extension, pronation, supination, radial deviation, or ulnar deviation. Likewise, there was no significant difference in grip strength, DASH scores, or VAS scores. When analyzing each cohort individually, both groups improved significantly after surgery with regard to DASH score, VAS score, and wrist extension. There was also a trend toward improved motion in all other directions except for an insignificant decrease in postoperative pronation in the repair group. Two patients in the USO group required additional surgery, with one revision performed for nonunion and one for painful hardware, which caused extensor carpi ulnaris tendonitis.CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that type 1B TFCC tears in the ulnar positive patient can be managed equivalently well with repair or USO.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic III.",The Journal of hand surgery,20888497,2010
Safety analysis of all-inside arthroscopic repair of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether an all-inside peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) repair using the FasT-Fix device (Smith &amp; Nephew Endoscopy, Andover, MA) is safe by measuring the proximity of the anchors to ulnar-sided anatomic structures.METHODS: Eleven fresh-frozen cadaveric wrists were thawed and placed in traction. Under direct arthroscopic visualization, an all-inside arthroscopic peripheral TFCC repair was completed by placing a single FasT-Fix device in a vertical mattress fashion. The wrists were then dissected to visualize the 2 anchors. The distance between these anchors and the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), and dorsal branch of the ulnar sensory nerve (DBUN) were measured with digital calipers and recorded.RESULTS: The peripheral anchor averaged 4.2 mm (range, 0 to 14 mm) from the ECU tendon, 3.8 mm (range, 0 to 9 mm) from the DBUN, and 8.3 mm (range, 1 to 15 mm) from the FCU tendon. The central anchor averaged 9.6 mm (range, 2 to 15 mm) from the ECU tendon, 6.8 mm (range, 1 to 13 mm) from the DBUN, and 7.6 mm (range, 1 to 13 mm) from the FCU tendon.CONCLUSIONS: This study exposes some safety concerns with the all-inside peripheral TFCC repair using the FasT-Fix device, which was found to reside in close proximity to the ECU, FCU, and DBUN. In multiple wrists the anchors were noted to underlie the anatomic structure that we measured, making it possible to pierce these structures with the needle before deployment of the anchor.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Though technically feasible, all-inside arthroscopic repair of the peripheral TFCC risks injury to the ulnar-sided anatomy.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,20851562,2010
The relationship between stress positions and pain intensity in triangular fibrocartilage lesions.,"We investigated the relationship between stress applied in several positions of the wrist and pain intensity in triangular fibrocartilage lesions in sixty-one patients who were diagnosed as having triangular fibrocartilage lesions and had a wrist arthroscopy. Before arthroscopy, we stressed the wrist with an axial load applied in four different wrist positions, and the evoked pain was graded into four levels. The patients who had a triangular fibrocartilage lesion on arthroscopy were divided into those with a traumatic tear and those with degenerative changes. While hypersupination and extension of wrist position evoked the most severe pain in patients with a traumatic tear, the intensity of pain did not relate to wrist rotation in patients with degenerative changes.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",20732927,2010
Triangular fibrocartilage complex tears associated with symptomatic ulnar styloid nonunions.,"PURPOSE: Tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and nonunion of the ulnar styloid are common lesions resulting from upper extremity injuries such as distal radius fractures. Whereas ulnar styloid fractures are a common feature of the distal radius fracture pattern, symptomatic nonunions of the ulnar styloid are found in a minority of these injuries. The purposes of this study were to confirm the association of symptomatic ulnar styloid nonunions and TFCC tears, and to report intra-articular findings and clinical outcomes for the concurrent arthroscopic management of TFCC tears and open excision of ulnar styloid nonunions in a consecutive series of patients.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 8 consecutive patients who underwent open excision of an ipsilateral ulnar styloid nonunion fragment and concurrent diagnostic arthroscopy. The diagnosis of TFCC tear was made by magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively in only 5 of 8 patients. We assessed outcomes with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire and the visual analog scale.RESULTS: Arthroscopic findings demonstrated full-thickness chondral injury on the dorsum of the triquetrum with a tear of the dorsal radiolunotriquetral ligament and avulsion of the ulnar margin of the TFCC from the extensor carpi ulnaris subsheath. The clinical outcome scores showed statistically significant improvement (p&lt;.05) from the preoperative baseline, with a mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score of 3.69 (SD, 9.68) and a mean visual analog scale pain score of 1.0 (SD, 0.83) postoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic ulnar styloid nonunions can be associated with TFCC tears, and diagnostic arthroscopy should be considered in all patients who are candidates for open excision of an ulnar styloid nonunion. Concurrent arthroscopic TFCC repair and open excision of the ulnar styloid fragment is an effective surgical approach for this combined injury pattern.",The Journal of hand surgery,20684924,2010
Radioulnar ratio in detection of distal radioulnar joint instability associated with acute distal radius fractures.,"Lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are commonly associated with distal radius fractures and may adversely affect the functional outcome. This prospective study evaluated computed tomography, using the radioulnar ratio (RUR), to detect laxity of the distal radioulnar joint in 48 consecutive patients with acute distal radius fractures and compared the results with a radioulnar stress test. We found the clinical stress test to be reliable in chronic cases, but the RUR method of questionable value in both acute and chronic cases.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",20621938,2010
Wrist injuries in young adults: the diagnostic impact of CT and MRI.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic impact of MRI or/and multidetector CT in young patients with wrist injury and inconclusive or negative clinical examination and X-rays and to analyze variations in imaging strategies between a district general hospital (GH) and a university hospital (UH).MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 34 young patients (mean age 23 years) with wrist trauma who underwent CT or/and MRI was performed. The injury was acute in 24, and chronic in 10 patients. Twenty-two patients were from a GH and 12 from a UH. Two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists blindly reviewed the imaging studies. The effect of cross-sectional imaging on patient care and treatment plan was evaluated.RESULTS: In 9 of 34 patients one or more fractures were diagnosed on cross-sectional imaging. The scaphoid was fractured in four patients, the lunate and/or the trapezium in three patients, the scaphoid together with the lunate in one patient, and finally the distal radius in one patient. Ligamentous trauma was identified solely on MRI in 11 patients (involving the TFCC in eight cases). In four patients with both imaging methods, CT revealed one fracture of the trapezium not seen on MRI, and one scapholunate fracture with MRI findings of distal radial fracture only. In two patients with normal CT, MRI revealed bone marrow oedema of the scaphoid in one and of the distal radius, lunate and triquetrum in the other.CONCLUSION: Both CT and MRI might be considered in patients with acute or chronic wrist injury, clinical dilemma and normal initial radiographs, depending on the availability and the individual institution policies.",European journal of radiology,20554419,2010
Distal radius instability and stiffness: common complications of distal radius fractures.,"Emphasis in the literature over the past hundred years regarding distal radius fracture management has been on restoration of anatomic radio-carpal alignment. Until the two most recent decades, little emphasis has been placed on the great morbidity and compromise to upper limb function associated with distal radio-ulna joint (DRUJ) pathology occurring with fractures of the distal radius. This article emphasizes that attention to restoration of anatomy of the DRUJ should be considered at least as important as that given to the radio-carpal relationship. This article also points out how stiffness of forearm rotation can result from a well-treated distal radius fracture and how this complication can be treated to restore healthy upper limb function.",Hand clinics,20494751,2010
[Intra- and interobserver reliability of digitally photodocumented findings in wrist arthroscopy].,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the intra- and interobserver reliability of findings in wrist arthroscopies documented by digital photography.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 102 consecutive wrist arthroscopies were documented by at least 6 photographs: (1) radioscaphoidal joint with radiopalmar ligaments, (2) scapholunate ligament from radiocarpal, (3) TFCC, (4) lunotriquetral joint with ulnar recessus, (5) scapholunate, and (6) lunotriquetral joint from midcarpal. More photographs were taken of additional pathologies. Arthroscopic findings were documented in an arthroscopy form (synovitis: no/yes, articular effusion: no/yes, cartilage lesion: no/yes). Lesions of the scapholunate ligament were classified according to Geissler, scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligament lesions were graded as partial or complete, TFCC lesions were categorised according to Palmer and trampoline effects noted. Three months later the 6 standard photos and then all photos were re-evaluated by the scoping surgeon and two experienced hand surgeons. Cohen's kappa was used as a measure of agreement between findings three months postoperatively and those in the operation report. Further statistical analyses were done, e. g., to compare intra- and interobserver reliability.RESULTS: In general intraobserver reliability (mean kappa 0.44) was better than interobserver reliability (0.28, 0.30). Assessing all available photos (0.47) did not improve reliability compared to assessing only the six standard photos (0.44). On grading scapholunate ligament lesions as partial or complete the interobserver reliability was fair (0.37, 0.30). Using Geissler's classification the interobserver reliability was κ=0.34 and 0.23. There was substantial intra- (0.61) and interobserver reliability (0.63, 0.60) for cartilage lesions. While intraobserver reliability for TFCC lesions was substantial (0.61), interobserver reliability was only moderate (0.31, 0.48).CONCLUSION: Even with wrist arthroscopy, the best diagnostic modality for scapholunate ligament, TFCC and carpal cartilage lesions, hand surgeons do not agree in diagnosis and pathology. Therefore, the documentation of arthroscopic findings has to be improved. Digital video documentation of wrist arthroscopy may illustrate wrist pathologies more adequately. However, this still has to be proven by further studies.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",20480459,2010
Importance of distal radioulnar joint arthroscopy for evaluating the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"BACKGROUND: The present study evaluated the importance of visualizing both sides of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) when diagnosing ulnar wrist pain.METHODS: A total of 20 patients with ulnar wrist pain who underwent both radiocarpal joint (RCJ) and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) arthroscopy were studied retrospectively. TFCC was graded as normal or as having wear or tear. The definitive diagnosis was made by evaluating the TFCC from both joints. The medical records were reviewed to document the preoperative diagnosis, arthroscopic findings, postoperative diagnosis, and operative procedure(s) performed after the arthroscopic examinations. The patients' status at final follow-up was evaluated using the modified Green and O'Brien wrist scoring system. The TFCC grading on RCJ and DRUJ arthroscopies was compared.RESULTS: The final diagnosis was modified after arthroscopic examination in three cases (15%). In six patients (30%), DRUJ arthroscopy revealed pathological TFCC findings that could not be detected on RCJ arthroscopy. The DRUJ arthroscopy detected wear or degenerative changes seen only on the proximal aspect of the TFCC in four patients and tear in two patients. On the other hand, in only one patient (5%) were there no pathological findings observed from the DRUJ portal, although RCJ arthroscopy found wear. In eight patients (45%), the arthroscopic grading of TFCC was the same on RCJ and DRUJ arthroscopy; of these, the TFCC was graded as normal in one patient, showing wear in three patients, and with a tear in five patients. For diagnosing TFCC pathology, RCJ arthroscopy had a sensitivity of 68% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 14%, whereas the sensitivity was 95% and the NPV was 50% for DRUJ.CONCLUSIONS: Adding DRUJ arthroscopy to RCJ arthroscopy enables more accurate diagnosis of TFCC pathology because the proximal aspect of the articular disk and the foveal insertion of the distal radioulnar ligament can be visualized.",Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association,20358334,2010
Investigation of transferrin polymorphism in Garole sheep.,"The aim of this study was to determine the genetics of polymorph systems of Transferrin in Garole sheep breed. The present study was conducted on 95 adult Garole sheep comprising 52 ewes and 43 rams, maintained at Sheep and Goat Breeding Farm of West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences, West Bengal, during the period from April-September, 2009. The polymorphism of transferrin was determined through SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique. It was found that the transferrin type was controlled by five codominant alleles (TfA, TfB, TfC TfD and TfE) in Garole sheep. These five alleles, because of co-dominant nature of inheritance, determined the occurrence of nine transferrin genotypes in the analyzed flock. Four (TfAA, TfBB, TfCC and TfDD) of these were homozygous and the remaining five (TfAD, TfBC, TfBD, TfCD and TfDE) heterozygous. It was found that the TfDD genotype (0.263) was predominant while TfDE genotype (0.042) was least common in the analyzed flock. Frequencies of other genotypes were as: TfCD(0.242), TfBD(0.126), TfCC(0.084), TfBB(0.074), TfAA(0.063), TfAD and TfBC (0.053 for each genotype ) in whole population. From the result it was found that in whole population combined, the heterozygotic genotypic frequency (0.516) was more than that of homozygotic genotypic frequency (0.484). Considerable variations were recognized in the frequencies of transferrin alleles. In the whole population frequencies of transferrin alleles were found to be TfA = 0.089, TfB = 0.163, TfC = 0.232, TfD = 0.495 and TfE = 0.021. Transferrin system has shown an absence of genetic equilibrium among the analyzed herd (chi2 value = 51.31). In conclusion, there were polymorphism in Transferrin types and the presence of differences among the frequencies of the five alleles by categories could be a source of genetic variation in Garole sheep.",Veterinary research communications,20349135,2010
Ulnar styloid impingement syndrome.,"The tip of an excessively long ulnar styloid can impinge upon the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) against the triquetrum. The subtleties in biomechanics of the wrist joint and their role in the production of the symptoms are presented as five cases from a retrospective study. The relationship of the symptoms to the patients' job activities is also discussed. The embryological and anatomical studies show that the tip of the ulnar styloid is covered by the TFCC. Therefore, the term &quot;ulnar styloid impingement syndrome&quot; is adopted for the entity in cases in which the TFCC has remained intact.",International orthopaedics,20186414,2010
A technique for arthroscopic all-inside suturing in the wrist.,"A technique for arthroscopic all-inside suturing in the wrist is presented.

[Kinematics of the triangular fibrocartilage complex during forearm rotation in vivo].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate three-dimensional kinematics of the superficial and deep portion of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in different parts of the forearm rotation.METHODS: Six wrists of 6 volunteers were used to obtain CT scans at different positions of the wrist. The wrists were scanned from 90 degrees of pronation to 90 degrees of supination at an interval of 30 degrees. The 3-dimensional radius and ulna were reconstructed with customized software and changes in length of the superficial and deep portion of TFCC during forearm rotation.RESULTS: In forearm pronation, the superficial dorsal portion and the deep palmar portion of the TFCC were tight. While the superficial palmar portion and the deep dorsal potion of the TFCC were lax. In supination, the changes in length of all these fibers were reverse.CONCLUSIONS: In forearm rotation one portion fibers of dorsal TFCC and one portion fibers of palmar TFCC are tight, and this mechanism controls stability during DRUJ rotation.",Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery],20137401,2010
Interosseous membrane reconstruction for the Essex-Lopresti injury.,"The Essex-Lopresti lesion, or radioulnar longitudinal dissociation, results from an axial load to the forearm with injury to the radial head and disruption of the interosseous membrane and the distal radioulnar joint. Unfortunately, an appreciation of the true extent of injury is not always realized in the acute setting, and patients present later with persistent or new reports of forearm discomfort and wrist and elbow pain. Reconstruction of the central band of the interosseous membrane with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft is useful in the chronic setting and is described.",The Journal of hand surgery,20117315,2010
[The hemiresection-interposition arthroplasty of the distal radioulnar joint].,"OBJECTIVE: Restoration of forearm rotation and pain relief at the distal radioulnar joint by resection of the joint surfaces of the ulnar head, interposition of a capsular-retinacular flap, and preservation or reconstruction of the ulnocarpal complex.INDICATIONS: Painful osteoarthritis of the distal radioulnar joint.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Longitudinal instability in the forearm, e.g., Essex-Lopresti lesions or after radial head resection. Posttraumatic ulnar subluxation of the carpus.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Exposition of the distal radioulnar joint via the floor of the fifth extensor compartment and preparation of an ulnarbased capsular-retinacular flap. Preservation of the fourth and sixth extensor compartment. Resection of the jointbearing areas of the ulnar head preserving the ulnar styloid and the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). If necessary, refixation or reconstruction of the TFCC. Interposition of the capsular-retinacular flap between the distal radius and ulna. Stabilization of the distal ulna by suture fixation of the dorsal part of the flap to the dorsal rim of the sigmoid notch.POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Immobilization in a long arm cast with 45 degrees forearm supination for 4 weeks. Afterwards, forearm pronation and supination are further limited for 4 weeks by a splint. Following that period, the range of motion and the load are raised to normal levels.RESULTS: The hemiresection-interposition arthroplasty of the distal radioulnar joint improves the range of forearm rotation. Pain is significantly reduced and grip strength increased. Instability of the distal ulna may persist or result; however, this gives rise to moderate complaints only in some patients. Patients' satisfaction is high and the functional results are good.",Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie,20058126,2010
Ulnar-sided wrist pain. II. Clinical imaging and treatment.,"Pain at the ulnar aspect of the wrist is a diagnostic challenge for hand surgeons and radiologists due to the small and complex anatomical structures involved. In this article, imaging modalities including radiography, arthrography, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), CT arthrography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and MR arthrography are compared with regard to differential diagnosis. Clinical imaging findings are reviewed for a more comprehensive understanding of this disorder. Treatments for the common diseases that cause the ulnar-sided wrist pain including extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendonitis, flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendonitis, pisotriquetral arthritis, triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions, ulnar impaction, lunotriquetral (LT) instability, and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability are reviewed.",Skeletal radiology,20012039,2009
Apoptotic pathways in degenerative disk lesions in the wrist.,"PURPOSE: Degenerative articular disk perforations of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) of the wrist could result from chronic loading of the ulnocarpal joint. Apoptosis played a crucial role in fibrocartilage cell loss, and the purpose of this study was to clarify which apoptotic pathway was involved in the development of degenerative disk lesions. We also investigated whether ulna length played an etiologic role in the occurrence of fibrocartilage cell loss.METHODS: Included in the study were 17 patients with degenerative articular disk tears of the TFC (Palmer type 2C). After arthroscopic debridement of the TFC, histologic sections were examined to assess the presence of apoptosis. Apoptosis was determined by use of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, Fas ligand and BID (BH3 interacting domain death) agonist were applied for immunohistochemical analysis.RESULTS: Cells positive for caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, Fas ligand, and BID were found in all specimens. The number of cells positive for caspase 3 and BID was significantly increased in specimens from patients with an ulna-positive variance. In contrast, for cells positive for caspase 8, caspase 9, and Fas ligand, no significant difference was found between specimens from patients with an ulna-positive variance and those from patients with an ulna-neutral/ulna-negative variance.CONCLUSIONS: The extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved in the development of degenerative disk lesions. Fibrocartilage cell loss occurs mainly through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The accumulation of apoptotic cells is not significantly different between the 3 zones of the TFC. It could be verified that ulna length is correlated with fibrocartilage cell loss.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Ulnar shortening is a valuable treatment option for degenerative TFC lesions. Knowledge of the specific apoptotic pathway that is causing degenerative disk lesions is critical in selecting the appropriate and most beneficial therapeutic treatment to halt further cell loss and the degeneration of the TFC.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,19962063,2009
Advantages of open repair of a foveal tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex via a palmar surgical approach.,"Foveal tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) can be repaired via a palmar surgical approach. Unlike the dorsal approach, in this method the floor of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon subsheath and the dorsal superficial limb of the radioulnar ligament do not hinder the view of the fovea. Patients with a fresh or chronic TFCC foveal tear and a positive ulnar fovea sign with its dorsal styloid insertion remaining intact are candidates for this procedure. During operation, the shoulder is positioned at 90 degrees of abduction, and the elbow is flexed at 90 degrees on an arm board. A 4 cm curved skin incision along the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon is made on the anterior aspect of the ulnar fovea. The ulnar fovea is exposed through a transverse capsulotomy of the distal radioulnar joint. The ulnocarpal joint distal to the TFCC is also exposed between the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon subsheath and the ulnotriquetrum ligament. After curettage of the scar tissues at the fovea, the lifted TFCC is sutured onto the fovea using a suture anchor technique.",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,19956042,2009
Expression of TRAIL and death receptor DR4 in Palmer type 2 TFCC lesions.,"INTRODUCTION: Degenerative articular disc perforations of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) of the wrist are characterized by fibrocartilage cell loss and are often associated with ulna-plus situations. Apoptosis has been found to play a crucial role in fibrocartilage cell loss, however, the molecular mechanism and mediators are still poorly understood.AIM: The purpose of this study was to identify receptors to apoptosis in degenerative disc lesions.PATIENTS: Included in the study were 17 patients with degenerative articular disc tears of the TFC (Palmer type 2C). Following arthroscopic debridement of the TFC, histological sections were examined to assess the presence of apoptosis. Apoptosis was determined using TRAIL and death receptor DR4 agonists for immunohistochemical analyses. The number of cells positive for apoptosis was then correlated with ulna length.RESULTS: Cells positive for TRAIL and DR4 were found in all specimens. The number of cells positive for TRAIL was significantly increased in specimens of patients with an ulna positive variance (P = 0.040). However, DR4 was not significantly increased in ulna plus (P &gt; 0.05). Both, TRAIL and DR4 positive cells were found to be evenly distributed throughout each specimen. There was no accumulation of any type of cells in any particular zone of the biopsies.CONCLUSION: This is the first study that shows that TFCC cells express TRAIL and DR4, which suggests that apoptosis, as well as, mechanical trauma are involved in the development of disc perforation. The TRAIL/DR4 receptor system is a molecular mediator of apoptosis induction in TFC cells and therefore plays a role in cell loss in degenerative disc lesions.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,19911185,2009
Tobacco-free community coalitions: opportunities for enhancing oral cancer prevention programs.,"BACKGROUND: This study identified oral cancer (OC) education and tobacco reduction collaboration within tobacco-free community coalitions (TFCC).METHODS: Data from 4 TFCC were collected via educational intervention surveys and structured focused group Interviews.RESULTS: Of the 52 participants, 96% were aware that tobacco products are risk factors for OC, yet 33% were unaware of the high OC impact locally. About 90% agreed that primary care providers and dentists should provide OC screenings and tobacco cessation.CONCLUSION: There is a need for provider endorsement and public demand for OC screenings. Opportunity exists for partnering and collaborative OC prevention with TFCC.",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,19838884,2009
[Palmar wrist arthroscopy for evaluation of concomitant carpal lesions in operative treatment of distal intraarticular radius fractures].,"Fractures of the distal radius, which currently are treated with palmar locking plates, are often accompanied by carpal lesions. Tears of the scapholunate interosseus ligament (SL) can affect the outcome. Between January 2007 and May 2008, 28 patients with distal intraarticular fractures of the radius were included in a prospective study. Preoperative CT-arthrography was performed. SL tears were found in 11 patients, with 10 partial and one complete rupture observed. A tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was detected in 16 patients. Every patient was operated with a palmar locking plate through a palmar approach between the flexor carpi radialis tendon and the radial artery. Then, a palmar wrist arthroscopy using a palmar portal was performed. Eleven SL tears with 9 partial and two total ruptures were diagnosed by arthroscopy. Ten lesions were associated with a C1-fracture with a fracture line projected onto the scapholunate interval. The TFCC was appraisable by palmar wrist arthroscopy only in 4 patients. Three of the SL tears detected by CT-arthrography could not be confirmed by palmar wrist arthroscopy. One complete rupture and one partial lesion confirmed by palmar wrist arthroscopy were found by CT-arthrography to be intact. Palmar wrist arthroscopy affords certainty when assessing the SL ligament. In this study, an assessment of ulnocarpal structures was not possible. For assessment of the ulnocarpal structures, CT-arthrography was superior to palmar wrist arthroscopy. However, the latter is an alternative during emergency treatment or when CT-arthrography is not available.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",19790024,2009
Ulnomeniscal homologue of the wrist: correlation of anatomic and MR imaging findings.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the anatomy of the ulnar side of the wrist in the region of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) complex, with special focus on the ulnomeniscal homologue (UMH) and its relationship to surrounding structures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were not required. Ten upper extremities were harvested from the nonembalmed cadavers of four women and six men (age range at death, 56-97 years; mean age at death, 83 years) and used according to institutional guidelines. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR arthrography of the wrist were performed with the wrist in neutral position, maximal ulnar deviation, and maximal radial deviation by using intermediate-weighted sequences. The specimens were cut into 4-mm-thick sections that corresponded to the MR imaging planes. The gross anatomic features of the UMH and its relationship to adjacent structures were evaluated and compared with imaging findings. UMH variants, as described in previous articles on purely anatomic studies, were sought on MR images. MR findings of the wrist in neutral position were compared with those of the wrist in maximal ulnar and radial deviations. Histologic examination was used to further elucidate the structure of the UMH.RESULTS: The UMH displayed complex anatomic features because of its obliquely oriented course. However, it could be divided into styloid, radioulnar, and collateral components and a distal insertion. The UMH variants described in previously published studies could be identified, but evaluation results were highly dependent on the wrist position at imaging.CONCLUSION: The anatomy of the UMH is complex. For assessment of the UMH and the ulnar side of the TFC complex, coronal MR arthrography with the wrist in neutral position or radial deviation might be superior to standard MR imaging.",Radiology,19789223,2009
A prospective study on the initial results of a low profile ulna shortening osteotomy system.,"Extra-articular ulna shortening osteotomy, in principle, is an accepted treatment option for symptomatic degenerative and traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears. Despite the benefits of this surgical approach, potential disadvantages include risk of nonunion, soft tissue irritation, and the need for future hardware removal. A recently introduced low profile ulna shortening system was designed to decrease these potential complications. A single-surgeon prospective study was performed to evaluate this system. Ten consecutive patients undergoing ulna shortening for ulnar-sided wrist pain compatible with TFCC pathology participated in the study. Subjective, objective, and radiographic assessments were performed preoperatively and up to 24 weeks postoperatively. Based on visual analog scale (VOS) ratings (0 to 10), pain scores significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05) and average patient satisfaction was 8.7. DASH and PRWE scores improved at three month follow-up (p &lt; 0.05). Osteotomy healing time averaged 10.3 weeks, and there were no nonunions. Average discomfort associated with palpation of the plate at final follow-up was 3.3 (using VOS), and one patient requested removal of the hardware. In this short-term follow-up study, the assessed ulna shortening system appears effective and, in general, well tolerated.","Hand (New York, N.Y.)",19784704,2009

The pERK level of the first trimester human cytotrophoblasts was analyzed by the way of western blotting.RESULTS: TFCC could promote viabilitylproliferation and PCNA expression of the first trimester human cytotrophobia in vitro, which could activate the ERK 1/2 in time-dependent and dosage-dependent manner.",Zhong yao cai = Zhongyaocai = Journal of Chinese medicinal materials,19764336,2009
The effect of triangular fibrocartilage complex injury on extensor carpi ulnaris function and friction.,"BACKGROUND: It has been previously shown that injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex increases the moment arm of the extensor carpi ulnaris. This will reduce the force producing capacity of the muscle in some situations, but will also increase its mechanical advantage. It is also possible that the change in the tendon path may increase tendon friction, predisposing the patient to future repetitive motion injury. It is the purpose of this study to determine the effects of triangular fibrocartilage complex injury on extensor carpi ulnaris moment producing capacity and tendon friction.METHODS: A simple simulation was used to examine muscle moment producing capacity throughout the range of motion, at varying speeds and in both injured and healthy states. Six fresh frozen human cadaveric wrists were used to determine the effect of injury on tendon friction. A custom made device was used to move the wrists through a range of motion, while a constant force was applied to the proximal tendon and force was recorded at the distal tendon. Friction was measured before and after the creation of injury.FINDINGS: The decreases in muscle force following injury were small, even in the worse case. The moment producing capacity of the muscle was increased following injury. Tendon friction during flexion-extension was decreased following injury. The friction during radial-ulnar deviation was unchanged.INTERPRETATION: When making surgical decisions about triangular fibrocartilage complex repair, it is not necessary to consider extensor carpi ulnaris moment producing capacity or tendon friction.","Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)",19733425,2009
Arthroscopic repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex using a hypodermic needle: a technical note.,"Tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) often lead to chronic wrist pain. The commonly used 2-needle outside-in and inside-out suturing techniques require an extra incision to tie the sutures subcutaneously. We use a practical and cost-effective arthroscopic technique for treatment of peripheral Palmer type 1B TFCC tears using a hypodermic needle. This obviates the need for an additional skin incision, thus lowering the risk of neurovascular damage, reducing postoperative pain, and enabling faster rehabilitation and better cosmesis.",Journal of orthopaedic surgery (Hong Kong),19721160,2009

High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions in acute wrist trauma: image quality at different field strengths.,"PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to assess the diagnostic capacity of a new high-resolution imaging protocol for the wrist and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions at 3.0 T and to compare it with our established 1.5-T protocol.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with an acute wrist trauma were examined at a 3.0-T imaging system and agreed to undergo an additional examination at 1.5 T. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed with 1.5-T (standard wrist coil) and 3.0-T (purpose-build phased-array coil) imaging system, using coronal T1-weighted turbo-spin-echo, proton density-weighted fat-saturated, and coronal and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo fat-saturated sequences, with reduced voxel size from 0.50 x 0.50 x 3.0 mm (1.5 T) to 0.20 x 0.20 x 1.5 mm (3.0 T). For qualitative analysis, 2 observers assessed in consensus delineation, image quality, and artifacts in anatomical landmarks (cartilage, TFCC, and TFCC lesion) and ranked them on a 5-point scale from 1 (nondiagnostic) to 5 (optimal). For quantitative analysis, measurements of the contrast-to-noise ratio were obtained between disk and surrounding tissue.RESULTS: All parts of the TFCC and TFCC lesions (n = 14) were seen significantly better at 3.0 T (mean [SD], 4.6 [0.5] vs 2.6 [1.2], P &lt; 0.0001), with higher ranked overall image quality. In 3 cases, TFCC lesions were seen only at 3.0 T. Proton density-weighted fat-saturated sequence had significantly more artifacts at 3.0 T (2.5 [0.6] vs 1.9 [0.5], P &lt; 0.001) in contrast to T1 sequences. Quantitative evaluation showed significantly higher contrast-to-noise ratio for 3.0 T (5.0 [1.1] vs 3.9 [0.9], P &lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSION: Depiction of anatomy and pathology of the TFCC benefits significantly from 3.0-T imaging when higher signal-to-noise ratio is invested into improved spatial resolution. Especially small lesions of the disk were detected only or better at 3.0 T.",Journal of computer assisted tomography,19638854,2009
New trends in arthroscopic management of type 1-B TFCC injuries with DRUJ instability.,"Advances in radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) diagnostic arthroscopy permits a treatment-oriented classification of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) peripheral tears: 1) repairable distal tears; 2) repairable complete tears; 3) repairable proximal tears; 4) non-repairable tears; and 5) tears associated with DRUJ arthritis. Class 1 tears should be sutured; Class 2 and 3 are associated with DRUJ instability and require TFCC reattachment to the fovea; Class 4 tears need reconstruction using a tendon graft and Class 5 tears require an arthroplasty. Arthroscopic assisted TFCC foveal reattachment is possible through the direct foveal portal, a dedicated DRUJ working portal. Arthroscopic TFCC reconstruction using a tendon graft showed promising results.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",19620186,2009
Arthroscopically assisted reattachment of avulsed triangular fibrocartilage complex to the fovea of the ulnar head.,"Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) insertion into the fovea of the distal ulna plays a crucial role in stabilizing the distal radioulnar joint. Consequently, surgical reattachment against avulsion of the foveal TFCC insertion is required to stabilize the distal radioulnar joint. However, because of technical difficulties, no arthroscopic procedure for such a lesion has currently been established. We present a new technique for arthroscopic reattachment of the avulsed TFCC into the fovea. An osseous tunnel 2.9 mm in diameter is created from the ulnar neck to the foveal surface. Under arthroscopic guidance, a nonabsorbable suture passed into a 21-gauge needle is placed into the TFCC through the osseous tunnel. The avulsed portion of the TFCC is anchored to the fovea by means of a repair suture passed through the TFCC. To achieve normal tension of the TFCC, the suture is tied onto the periosteum around the proximal entrance of the osseous tunnel. Our arthroscopic technique is relatively simple and has great advantages for progressive healing at the attachment site between the TFCC and the fovea.",The Journal of hand surgery,19556075,2009
Cartilage cell proliferation in degenerative TFCC wrist lesions.,"INTRODUCTION: The central zone of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) of the wrist is thought to be avascular and is generally considered to lack any healing potential.AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate, if cartilage cells of degenerative disc lesions possess any healing or proliferation potential and whether ulna length plays a significant role in the proliferation process.RESULTS: Cells positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were found in all specimens. Specimens of patients with ulna positive variance showed a decreased number of PCNA positive cells than specimens of patients with either negative or neutral ulna variance.CONCLUSION: We found that cartilage cells of Palmer type 2C lesions undergo mitotic cell division, thus exhibiting proliferation capability. It could not be shown that ulnar length is significantly correlated with the number of PCNA positive cells.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,19415312,2009

The effect of multiplanar distal radius fractures on forearm rotation: in vitro biomechanical study.,"PURPOSE: Many patients develop distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) pain and loss of forearm rotation after distal radial fractures. Residual distal radial deformity is one potential cause of DRUJ dysfunction; however, the parameters of distal radial fracture alignment that lead to an acceptable functional outcome are poorly defined in the literature.METHODS: We used 8 fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens in this in vitro study to examine the effect of simulated distal radius fracture misalignment on forearm rotation. A distal radial osteotomy was performed just proximal to the DRUJ and a custom-made, 3-degrees-of-freedom modular implant designed to simulate distal radius fracture deformities was secured in place. This allowed for accurate simulation of dorsal angulation, dorsal translation, and radial shortening, both independently and in combination. We examined the effects of distal radius deformity in the setting of both an intact and sectioned triangular fibrocartilage complex.RESULTS: Pronation was not significantly affected until dorsal angulation reached 30 degrees . Dorsal translation of up to 10 mm or radial shortening up to 5 mm had no effect on forearm rotation. Combined deformities had a greater effect on forearm motion than isolated malpositions. Dorsal angulation of &gt; or =20 degrees combined with 10 mm of dorsal translation or 20 degrees of angulation with 2.5 mm of radial shortening resulted in a significant decrease in forearm pronation. There was no effect of distal radial deformities, either isolated or combined, on the magnitude of forearm rotation after sectioning the triangular fibrocartilage complex.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a broad range of distal radius fracture malpositions can be tolerated before a notable loss in forearm range of motion is evident. Combined deformities are more likely to result in a clinically important loss of forearm rotation, and this should be considered when choosing the optimal management of patients with displaced distal radial fractures. Disruption of the triangular fibrocartilage releases the tether on the DRUJ, allowing for preservation of forearm motion even in the setting of marked osseous deformities.",The Journal of hand surgery,19410987,2009
All-arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex repair: safety and biomechanical comparison with a traditional outside-in technique in cadavers.,"PURPOSE: To compare the biomechanical strength and safety of an all-arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage (TFCC) repair technique with an outside-in technique in cadavers.METHODS: Ten matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric wrists were used for this study. The control group TFCC tears were treated with an outside-in technique using 2-0 polydioxane (PDS) sutures. The experimental group was treated with two FasT-Fix suture devices. I measured the location of the implants in relation to the neurovascular structures using a digital caliper. The strength of the repairs was then determined using a tensile testing machine with the load placed across the repair site. I compared results using the Student's t-test.RESULTS: The most volar FasT-Fix block averaged 1.8 cm from the ulnar neurovascular bundle, whereas the PDS knots averaged 1.9 cm from it. The most dorsal FasT-Fix averaged 17.1 mm from the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve, whereas the PDS knot was 4.6 mm. The average load to failure for the FasT-Fix repairs was 3.7 N, compared with 2.4 N for the PDS repairs (p &lt; .05). The mode of failure for the FasT-Fix implants was the suture cutting through the TFCC tissue. The mode of failure for the PDS controls varied between the suture cutting through the tissue and the knots untying. One extensor carpi ulnaris tendon was injured by the PDS technique. No tendons were injured with the FasT-Fix technique.CONCLUSIONS: This all-arthroscopic technique of TFCC repair is faster and stronger than the inside-out technique and is equally safe. Benefits of this repair are decreased operative time, reduced postoperative immobilization, and decreased irritation from prominent suture knots below the skin. For these reasons, it may be desirable to perform this technique to improve patient satisfaction.",The Journal of hand surgery,19345869,2009
[Arthroscopic refixation of traumatic 1B-lesions of the TFCC--a retrospective study].,"AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the postoperative outcome of the arthroscopic sutures of traumatic 1B-lesions of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears.METHODS: Thirty-six patients who underwent an arthroscopic repair of traumatic 1B-lesions of the TFCC without a dislocation of the ulnar styloid process were included in this study. The average age of the 18 male and 18 female patients was 43.8 (range: 22-70) years. In 16 cases, we operated the left and in 20 cases the right TFCC. On average, the follow-up examination was performed after 7.9 years (range: 3.2-14.3) years. Patients with revision operations or neurovascular pathology were excluded. The Mayo modified wrist score and the disability of arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score were used to identify the outcome.RESULTS: The Mayo modified wrist score was preoperatively 49.74+/-20.99 and postoperatively 82.43+/-15.89 (p&lt;0.001). The DASH score was preoperatively 48.68+/-21.47 and postoperatively 24.1+/-19.81 (p&lt;0.001). Only five patients demonstrated an isolated 1B-lesion of the TFCC and showed, likewise, significant improvements both regarding the DASH score and the Mayo modified wrist score (p&lt;0.05). However, there was no significant difference to the patients with further wrist injuries (p&gt;0.05).CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that 1B-lesions of the TFCC can be successfully repaired by arthroscopically assisted suture techniques. An isolated 1B-lesion of the TFCC is rather unusual.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",19322748,2009
The distal radioulnar joint.,"The distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) acts in concert with the proximal radioulnar joint to control forearm rotation. The DRUJ is stabilized by the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). This complex of fibrocartilage and ligaments support the joint through its arc of rotation, as well as provide a smooth surface for the ulnar side of the carpus. TFCC and DRUJ injuries are part of the common pattern of injuries we see with distal radius fractures. While much attention has been paid to the treatment of the distal radius fractures, many of the poor outcomes are due to untreated or unrecognized injuries to the DRUJ and its components.",Bulletin of the NYU hospital for joint diseases,19302063,2009
Extensor retinaculum capsulorrhaphy for ulnocarpal and distal radioulnar instability: the Herbert sling.,"Wrist pain and instability are challenging problems that may be the result of pathology at the distal radioulnar (DRUJ) or ulnocarpal joints or both. Instability of the wrist can often be attributed to a compromise of the integrity of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), a key soft tissue stabilizer of the DRUJ and ulnocarpal articulations. Subsequently, when surgical reconstruction is indicated, techniques should strive to restore the biarthrodial function of the TFCC. Although anatomic reconstruction of the DRUJ ligaments provides successful stabilization of the radioulnar articulation, those patients who present with concomitant ulnocarpal instability require an alternative technique that addresses both the DRUJ- and ulnocarpal-stabilizing functions of the TFCC. The Herbert sling, which is an extensor retinaculum capsulorrhaphy, is an effective method of creating a strong tether among the distal radius, ulna, and ulnar carpus. Preliminary biomechanical and clinical results have been encouraging.",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,19276922,2009

In vivo 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging of the wrist and hand: technical aspects and applications.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7.0 T has the potential for higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), improved spectral resolution, and faster imaging compared with 1.5-T and 3.0-T MR systems. This is especially interesting for challenging imaging regions like the wrist and the hand because of the small size of the visualized anatomical structures; the increase in SNR could then be directly converted into higher spatial resolution of the images. Practically, imaging at 7.0 T poses a variety of technical challenges such as static (B (0)) and radiofrequency (B (1)) homogeneities, shimming, chemical shift artifacts, susceptibility artifacts, alterations in tissue contrast, specific absorption rate limitations, coil construction, and pulse sequence tuning. Despite these limitations, this first experience in anatomical imaging of the wrist and the hand at 7.0 T is very promising. Functional imaging techniques will gain importance at ultra-high-field MRI and need to be assessed in detail in the future.",Seminars in musculoskeletal radiology,19235674,2009
Ultrasonographic study of wrist ligaments: review and new perspectives.,"Imaging strategy for wrist injury usually begins with standard radiographs. When a ligamentous disorder is suspected clinically, the next step is arthrographic computed tomography or arthrographic magnetic resonance imaging. When the diagnosis remains unclear, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred examination. Ultrasonography is usually used to assess structures like tendons and bone surface, but thanks to the performances of high-frequency transducers, it can also enable visualization of the main ligaments of the wrist. Ultrasonography could thus replace MRI because of its lower cost, as recently reported in the literature. However, a good knowledge of normal and pathological wrist anatomy is required to avoid false negatives. Wrist ligaments comprise interosseous and capsular ligaments as well as the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex. All these ligaments may be involved in carpal instability. Clinical examination has a major role to play in helping radiologists orient their procedures. A few studies have reported that ultrasonography of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex is reliable compared with arthrography or MRI, but most of these studies were limited to the radioulnar ligaments. In this article we propose a more extensive protocol.",Seminars in musculoskeletal radiology,19235672,2009
MDCT arthrography or MR arthrography for imaging the wrist joint?,"Imaging of the wrist joint has been radically modified over the last decade, particularly since multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) arthrography and magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography have become widely available. These two modalities allow a confident assessment of ligament tears and potential diagnosis of associated abnormalities of cartilage, bone, and soft tissues. The interosseous scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments and the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are the most important structures to consider. Precise analysis of their different lesions, including recognition of degenerative tears, is essential for guiding the treatment. After a brief overview of the different injuries of interosseous ligaments and cartilage, this article thoroughly exposes the technical aspects of wrist MDCT arthrography and MR arthrography, reviews their results, and discusses their performances in light of recent literature. Finally, we propose an imaging strategy to decide between MDCT arthrography and MR arthrography depending on the clinical query. Other imaging modalities are not forgotten in this strategy. The evaluation of ligamentous and TFCC pathology must always begin with conventional radiographs. Cineradiography, ultrasound, and standard MRI are also useful in selected cases.",Seminars in musculoskeletal radiology,19235671,2009
MDCT arthrography of the wrist: diagnostic accuracy and indications.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and indications of arthrography with Multidetector Computed Tomography (arthro-MDCT) of the wrist in patients with absolute or relative contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and in patients with periarticular metal implants using diagnostic arthroscopy as the gold standard.MATERIALS AND METHODS: After intra-articular injection of iodixanol and volumetric acquisition, 43 wrists in patients of both genders (18 females, 25 males, age range 32-60 years) were examined with a 16-detector-row CT scanner. Fifteen patients had prior wrist surgery. The patients had arthralgia, degenerative and traumatic arthropathies as well as limited range of motion, but no radiologically detected fractures. All examinations were interpreted by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. The findings were compared with arthroscopic findings carried out within 28 days of the CT study.RESULTS: In non-operated and operated wrists the comparison between arthro-MDCT and arthroscopy showed sensitivity, specificity and accuracy ranging between 92% and 94% for triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), between 80% and 100% for intrinsic ligaments located within the proximal carpal compartment, and between 94% and 100% for articular cartilage. Inter-observer agreement between two radiologists, in the evaluation of all types of lesions, was almost perfect (k=0.96) and statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Arthro-MDCT of the wrist provides an accurate diagnosis to identify chondral, fibrocartilaginous and intra-articular ligament lesions in patients who cannot be evaluated by MRI, and in post-surgical patients.",European journal of radiology,19233582,2009

Progesterone and prolactin levels in the serum were measured by radioimmunoassay, the protein expression of PR was inspected by immunohistochemical, RT-PCR was applied to determine the expression of Thl/Th2 mRNA on deciduas.RESULTS: In the deciduas of model group, IL-4 and IL-10 cytokine contens were clearly lower than that of normal pregnancy group. The difference was notable(P &lt; 0.05), In the deciduas of model group, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha cytokine contents were clearly higher than that of normal pregnancy group. The difference was notable (P &lt; 0.05), TFCC could up-regulate the level of IL-4 and IL-10, and down-regulate the level of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, which could promote P secretion and up regulate PR mRNA expression on deciduas.CONCLUSION: TFCC can regulate endocrinologycal and immunological network equilibration on maternal-fetal face, finally achieve prevention abortion.",Zhong yao cai = Zhongyaocai = Journal of Chinese medicinal materials,19112902,2008
"[Diagnostic value of unspecific requested and implemented MRI for detecting intracarpal lesions, compared to arthroscopic findings at 217 patients].","AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of MRI for detecting intracarpal lesions in clinical routine.PATIENTS AND MATERIALS: In a retrospective study, we reviewed the charts of 506 patients who had undergone wrist arthroscopy in our department between May 1998 and November 2002. Out of 506 patients 217 had an MRI. The MRI was performed at 31 different radiology facilities using a number of techniques. The MRI results were compared with the arthroscopic findings, taking the arthroscopic results as a &quot;gold standard&quot; (sensitivity = SEN, specificity = SPE, positive predictive value = PPV, negative predictive value = NPV, accuracy = ACC).RESULTS: The following results were found: For tears of the scapholunate ligament the avalues are SEN 18.5 %, SPE 95 %, PPV 71 %, NPV 66 %, ACC66 %. Not one of 16 tears of the lunotriquetral ligament was found by MRI.CONCLUSION: In our data we found a low sensitivity for unspecific requested and implemented MRI for detecting intracarpal lesions. Therefore the indication for MRI should only be made after experienced hand surgeons have examined the wrist. In our opinion, only direct MR-arthrography is equal to arthroscopy, so that only an experienced radiologist who is familiar with this technique should perform the MRI diagnostics of the hand.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",19101889,2008
Comparison of 3-T MRI and arthroscopy of intrinsic wrist ligament and TFCC tears.,"OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the sensitivity and specificity of MRI at 3 T compared with arthroscopy for detection of intrinsic wrist ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR wrist images in 300 consecutive patients underwent consensus review by two radiologists without knowledge of arthroscopy findings. Forty-nine of 300 patients underwent arthroscopy. Thirty-five of these 49 patients also underwent MR arthrography. Scans were assessed for full-thickness scapholunate, lunatotriquetral, or TFCC tears. After consensus review of MR images, arthroscopy results were compared with MR interpretations.RESULTS: Of the 49 patients who underwent arthroscopy, 22 had TFCC tears, 18 had scapholunate tears, and 11 had lunatotriquetral tears (51 total tears at arthroscopy). Nineteen of 22 TFCC tears, 16 of 18 scapholunate tears, and nine of 11 lunatotriquetral tears seen at arthroscopy were seen on MRI. Four patients had both a TFCC tear and a lunatotriquetral ligament tear. One patient had a scapholunate ligament tear and a TFCC tear. There were no false-positive readings on MRI compared with arthroscopy. MR sensitivity for detection of TFCC tears was 86%, for detection of scapholunate tears was 89%, and for detection of lunatotriquetral tears was 82%. MR specificity for detection of tears was 100%. MR arthrography sensitivity for detection of ligament and TFCC tears was 100%. There were three patients in whom contrast media passed between joint spaces without an anatomic abnormality seen. These patients underwent arthroscopy with no tears seen.CONCLUSION: MRI at 3 T is sensitive and specific for detection of wrist ligament tears. MR arthrography is more sensitive for ligament evaluation but can result in false-positive findings because of microperforations.",AJR. American journal of roentgenology,19098183,2008
Arthroscopic foveal repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex peripheral lesion with distal radioulnar joint instability.,"There is still controversy regarding the value of arthroscopic suture of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) peripheral tears compared with open transosseous repair because only the latter method restores foveal insertions of TFCC in case of distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability. Five classes of TFCC peripheral tears are recognized in a treatment-oriented algorithm based on arthroscopic findings, and indications to proper treatment are set accordingly. Complete repairable tears (class 2) and proximal repairable tears (class 3) are associated with DRUJ instability and require foveal reattachment of the TFCC. We describe a new arthroscopic technique to repair the foveal attachment of the TFCC with the use of a suture anchor, which is indicated for class 2 and 3 TFCC peripheral tears, instead of an open repair. This technique requires a dedicated working portal to approach the fovea ulnaris. This Direct Foveal portal is used to prepare the ligament and bone and to drill and insert a suture anchor loaded with a pair of sutures. Under arthroscopic vision, a suture is passed through each limb of the ligament and tied using a small knot-pusher. This arthroscopic technique restores original TFCC anatomy and adequate DRUJ stability with less morbidity and potentially accelerated rehabilitation compared with open repair.",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,19060683,2008
Arthroscopic treatment of triangular fibrocartilage wrist injuries in the athlete.,"BACKGROUND: Triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) injuries are an increasingly recognized cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain and can be particularly disabling in the competitive athlete. Previous studies show that arthroscopic debridement or repair can improve symptoms, but the results of arthroscopic treatment of TFC injuries in high-level athletes have not yet been reported.HYPOTHESIS: Arthroscopic debridement or repair of wrist TFC injury will allow a high rate of return to full function in the elite athlete.STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.METHODS: Between 2001 and 2005, 16 competitive athletes (mean age, 23.4 years) with wrist TFC injuries underwent arthroscopic surgery. Repair was performed in unstable tears, and all others underwent debridement alone. Presurgery and post-surgery mini-DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) scores were recorded for each athlete through medical record review and clinical evaluation. The mean duration of follow-up was 32.8 months (range, 24-51 months).RESULTS: The TFC was repaired in 11 (68.8%) and debrided in 5 (31.3%) patients. The tear was ulnar-sided in 12 (75%), radial-sided in 2 (12.5%), combined radial-ulnar in 1, and central-sided in 1 patient. Mean mini-DASH scores improved from 47.3 (range, 25-65.9) to 0 (all patients) (P = .002), and the mean mini-DASH sports module improved from 79.7 (range, 68.8-100) to 1.95 (range, 0-18.8) (P = .002). Return to play averaged 3.3 months (range, 3-7 months). Associated conditions in the 2 patients unable to return to play at 3 months were distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability with ulnar-carpal abutment (n = 1) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendinosis (n = 1).CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic debridement or repair of wrist TFC injury provides predictable pain relief and return to play in competitive athletes. Return to play may be delayed in athletes with concomitant ulnar-sided wrist injuries.",The American journal of sports medicine,19059892,2008
MR arthrography of the wrist: controversies and concepts.,"Magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) has become the preferred modality for imaging patients with internal derangement of the wrist. However, several aspects of MRA use need to be clarified before a standardized approach to the imaging of internal derangement of the wrist can be developed. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficiency of different magnetic resonance (MR) sequences in the detection of lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments on direct MRA. Thirty-one consecutive direct magnetic resonance arthrographic examinations of the wrist using a wrist surface coil were performed for the assessment of the TFCC and intrinsic ligaments on a 1.5-T MR imaging system (Signa; 16 channel, Excite, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). All patients had wrist pain, and in six cases, there was associated clinical carpal instability. The presence, location, and extent of TFCC, scapholunate ligament (SLL), and lunotriquetral ligament (LTL) lesions on T1 fat-saturated, multiplanar gradient recalled (MPGR) and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images were identified, compared, and analyzed. Forty-one lesions of the TFCC, SLL, and LTL were visualized on contrast-sensitive (T1 fat-saturated) images in 23/31 (74.2%) patients. Twenty-one lesions of the TFCC and intrinsic ligaments were visualized on noncontrast-sensitive (MPGR and STIR) images (15 tears of the TFCC and six tears of the SLL and LTL). All of these lesions were seen on T1 fat-saturated images; 48.8% (20/41) lesions seen on T1 fat-saturated images (eight tears of TFCC and 12 tears of SLL and LTT) were not seen on MPGR and/or STIR images. Superior contrast resolution, joint distention, and the flow of contrast facilitate the diagnosis of lesions of the TFCC and intrinsic ligaments on contrast-sensitive sequences making MRA the preferred modality for imaging internal derangements of the wrist. Little agreement exists regarding the value and location of perforations of the intrinsic ligaments given that both traumatic and degenerative perforations may be symptomatic. Noncommunicating defects of the ulnar attachments of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC), tears of the dorsal segment of the SLL, and defects at the lunate attachment of the SLL have a higher likelihood of being symptomatic and caused by trauma rather than by degenerative perforation. Although no consensus exists, it would appear that most arthrographies should be started with a radiocarpal injection. Injection into the distal radioulnar joint should be added if no communicational defects are visualized following radiocarpal injection in patients with ulnar-sided wrist pain.","Hand (New York, N.Y.)",19048349,2008
"[Dislocation fractures of the forearm. Galeazzi, Monteggia, and Essex-Lopresti injuries].","Combined forearm fractures are identified according to their location as Galeazzi, Monteggia, or Essex-Lopresti injuries. The feature common to these three forms is the combination of a forearm fracture with instability of the distal or proximal radioulnar joint. Appropriate management of the injury at an early stage is indispensable to achieve good functional results. Galeazzi fractures should initially be treated by open reduction and correct anatomy restored by plate osteosynthesis. Fixation of the distal radioulnar joint with Kirschner wires should be performed in cases of persistent dislocation or instability and limited to 6 weeks. Monteggia fractures should be surgically approached, taking care not to overlook possible additional injuries (radial head, coronoid process). Essex-Lopresti injuries are treated by surgical reconstruction of the radial head, and in cases of comminuted fractures by implanting a radial head prosthesis. Subsequent treatment entails at least 14 days immobilization in a supinated position using an upper arm cast. Early functional therapy should follow when all three forms of injuries have been treated.",Der Unfallchirurg,19039567,2008
Ligamentous injuries of the wrist.,"The purpose of this review is to summarize ligamentous injury of the wrist. Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), scapholunate ligament (SLL), and lunotriquetral ligament (LTL) are crucial to wrist stability. Damage to these ligaments causes changes in bone alignment and altered motion pattern. This may cause pain and eventually osteoarthritis. Imaging techniques of the wrist include conventional arthrography, computed tomography (CT) arthrography, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MR arthrography. Especially, MRI plays an important role in the assessment of TFCC, SLL, and LTL. Therefore, special attention is drawn to normal and abnormal MR imaging appearance of these ligaments in this review. Variety of treatment options dependent on classification of TFCC and ligamentous injury as well as role of imaging in the patient treatment are also discussed.",Seminars in musculoskeletal radiology,19016398,2008

Comparison of ulnar-shortening osteotomy with a new Trimed dynamic compression system versus the Synthes dynamic compression system: clinical study.,"PURPOSE: Ulnar-shortening osteotomy has become common in the treatment of symptomatic positive ulnar variance. Our goal was to evaluate prospectively a new dynamic compression plating system in comparison with a commonly used dynamic compression system. In contrast with other systems, the new system uses a slotted hole that enables fixation of the plate to the bone prior to performing the osteotomy, a fitted compression clamp, and a lag screw. Cutting guides that attach directly to plate eliminate the need for freehand osteotomies.METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were treated with a 3.5-mm, 6-hole dynamic compression plate with distraction device (Synthes, Paoli, PA) and compared with 17 patients treated with a new dynamic compression system manufactured by Trimed (Valencia, CA). Procedure length was recorded. The patients were evaluated for amount of shortening, pain, range of motion, grip strength, time to union, and return to work as well as with validated outcome measures.RESULTS: Improvement was found in all measures although no difference was found between the 2 groups other than significantly shorter length of operation with the Trimed system (a mean of 2 hours with the Synthes system vs 1 hour with the Trimed system). Ten plates were removed in the Synthes group and 4 plates were removed in the Trimed group because of symptomatic prominence of the plate. There were no infections, delayed unions, or nonunions in either group.CONCLUSIONS: The new Trimed plating system for ulnar shortening was found to be as effective as the Synthes system and with a shorter procedure time. This may be related to the different measuring periods, although years of practice with the Synthes technique preceded this study. We believe the shortened procedure time for the Trimed system is due to its technical advantages.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic III.",The Journal of hand surgery,18984329,2008

Arthroscopic repair of Palmer 1B triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this retrospective study was to determine functional and subjective outcomes of patients with Palmer type 1B tears repaired arthroscopically and to investigate whether clinical outcomes are related to ulna length.METHODS: Forty-six patients with arthroscopic repair of Palmer type 1B tears were reviewed. There were 23 males and 23 females. The average age was 34 years (range, 10 to 58 yrs). The average follow-up was 11 months (range, 6 to 23 mos), and the delay to surgery was 9.7 months. All patients suffered ulnar-sided wrist pain and were diagnosed with Palmer type 1B tears. The tear was repaired arthroscopically with an inside-outside suture technique. The range of motion (ROM), grip strength, pain, wrist score (modified Mayo wrist score), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH) score, and ulna length (static and dynamic) were evaluated.RESULTS: There was a reduction in pain and an improvement in grip strength. Postoperative ROM averaged 128 degrees +/- 23 degrees for the extension/flexion arc, 41 degrees +/- 11 degrees for the radial/ulnar deviation arc, and 171 degrees +/- 19 degrees for the pronation/supination arc of motion. However, no relation could be found between ulna length and clinical outcome. The modified Mayo wrist score was rated excellent in 22% of patients, good in 41%, fair in 27%, and poor in 10%. The average DASH score was 21.70 +/- 17.17 (range, 0 to 58.33).CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic repair of Palmer type 1B tears yields satisfactory results. Sixty-three percent of patients achieved good to excellent results, experienced increased ROM, grip strength, and pain relief. Ulnar neutral or positive variance is not a contraindication for suture repair and does not require simultaneous ulna shortening when repairing the triangular fibrocartilage complex arthroscopically. A delay to surgery did not affect clinical outcome.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,18971054,2008
Arthroscopic treatment of ulnar impaction syndrome.,"Ulnar impaction syndrome occurs in the setting of a central traumatic or degenerative defect in the triangular fibrocartilage complex in patients with ulnar positive variance. Chondral and subchondral edema, mechanical impingement of the articular disc, and chondromalacia of the distal ulna, proximal lunate, and proximal triquetrum produce symptoms with activity that do not improve with rest. Decreasing ulnocarpal load-sharing across the wrist with recession of the distal ulna is necessary to relieve symptoms in the majority of patients. Arthroscopic treatment with triangular fibrocartilage complex debridement and arthroscopic ulnar wafer resection is an effective treatment for ulnar impaction syndrome. It affords a single-stage, minimally invasive approach, with similar efficacy and fewer complications than open wafer resection or ulnar shortening osteotomy.",The Journal of hand surgery,18929214,2008
Change in the length of the ulnocarpal ligaments during radiocarpal motion: possible impact on triangular fibrocartilage complex foveal tears.,"PURPOSE: The fovea of the ulnar head is the primary attachment site for both the distal radioulnar and the ulnocarpal ligaments. Thus, both ligaments should be simultaneously affected by the traumatic avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex from its ulnar attachment. Little attention, however, has been directed toward the role of the ulnocarpal ligaments in the mechanics of this type of injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in length of the ulnocarpal ligaments during various radiocarpal motions and to determine the type of radiocarpal motion that makes the ulnocarpal ligament taut and that could cause foveal avulsion if it were excessive.METHODS: The 3-dimensional kinematics of the wrist joint were investigated noninvasively using a markerless bone registration technique in vivo. Magnetic resonance images of the wrists of 15 healthy volunteers were acquired in at least 5 positions during each wrist flexion-extension motion, radioulnar deviation, or the so called dart-throwing motion (radial extension-ulnar flexion motion). The 3-dimensional ligament paths of the ulnotriquetral, ulnolunate, ulnocapitate, and palmar radioulnar ligaments were modeled as the shortest paths between the fovea and the insertion point of each ligament. Changes in the 3-dimensional ligament length of each ligament between the neutral position and each wrist position were then calculated.RESULTS: The lengths of the ulnotriquetral and ulnocapitate ligaments increased the most on wrist radial extension, and the length of the ulnolunate ligament increased the most on wrist extension. The length of the palmar radioulnar ligament changed minimally during any motion.CONCLUSIONS: The ulnocarpal ligaments are likely to be stretched tensely in wrist radial extension and wrist extension. This study supports the hypothesis that one of the mechanisms responsible for a triangular fibrocartilage complex foveal tear is excessive traction of the ulnocarpal ligament caused by a fall on the outstretched hand.",The Journal of hand surgery,18929189,2008
Normal ultrasound anatomy of the triangular fibrocartilage of the wrist: a study on cadavers and on healthy subjects.,"PURPOSE: To report the normal sonographic anatomy of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) of the wrist in cadavers and volunteers.METHOD: Five hands from cadavers were examined sonographically before and after wrist dissection, during which the TFC was marked with surgical wires. Twenty volunteers without wrist limitation or pain, and without any history of wrist disease or inflammatory arthritis (mean age, 26 years (range,19-45 years) were also examined.RESULTS: Sonograms showed that the meniscus and the TFC were clearly separated. The meniscus appeared as a triangular structure that was homogeneous and slightly hyperechoic. Compared with the meniscus, the TFC appeared hypoechoic. The same patterns were observed for cadavers and volunteers. In 3 volunteers (15%), the TFC was not visualized.CONCLUSIONS: Using high-resolution ultrasound systems, the TFC can be separated from meniscus. However, visualization of the TFC remains limited due to its deep location and the presence of acoustic shadowing from bony structures.",Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,18855934,2008
Ulnar shortening after TFCC suture repair of Palmer type 1B lesions.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine functional and subjective outcomes of an ulnar shortening procedure elected by patients who experienced persistent ulno-carpal symptoms following arthroscopic suture repair of a Palmer type 1B lesion. All patients had a dynamic ulna positive variance.METHODS: Five patients (3 males and 2 females) with arthroscopic repair of Palmer type 1B tears who subsequently underwent ulnar shortening were reviewed. At the time of the arthroscopic repair the patients' average age was 37 +/- 13 years (range 16-52 years). Average time to follow-up was 14 +/- 6 months (range 10-23 months). The average age was 38 +/- 14 years (range 17-53 years) when the ulnar shortening was performed. The second follow-up took place 7 +/- 2 months (range 5-9 months) after ulnar shortening. During the follow-ups, range of motion, grip strength, pain, Modified Mayo Wrist Score, DASH Score, and ulnar length were evaluated. Citing persistent ulno-carpal symptoms, the patients elected ulnar shortening an average of 17 +/- 7months (range 13-29 months) following the arthroscopic repair. Prior to ulnar shortening the average static ulnar variance was 0.2 +/- 1.3 mm (range -1 to 2 mm), the average dynamic ulnar variance was 1.4 +/- 0.5 mm (range 1 to 2 mm).RESULTS: Ulnar shortening brought about further reduction in pain after the arthroscopic repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) had already reduced it. As measured by a visual analogue scale, the average value after ulnar shortening was 2.2 +/- 2.1 (range 0.7-5.0). The average static ulnar variance was -3.4 +/- 2 mm (range -5 to -1 mm). Patients were very satisfied with the results of the ulnar shortening and four out of five indicated that it had significantly improved their symptoms and they would elect ulnar shortening again. Postoperative range of motion as a percentage of the contralateral side averaged 90% for the extension/flexion arc, 80% for the radial/ulnar deviation arc, and 100% for the pronation/supination arc of motion. In addition, there was an improvement in grip strength. The Modified Mayo Wrist Score was rated excellent in three patients, and fair in two patients. The average DASH score was 22 +/- 22 (range 0-53).CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have a dynamic ulna positive variance and experience persistent ulno-carpal symptoms following arthroscopic suture repair of a Palmer type 1B lesion, benefit from an ulnar shortening procedure. Shortening the ulna can improve these patients' symptoms of pain, range of motion, and grip strength.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,18795305,2008
Reconstruction for DRUJ instability.,"The skeletal architecture of the DRUJ provides minimal inherent stability, as the sigmoid notch is shallow and its radius of curvature is 50% greater than that of the ulnar head [Af Ekenstam F, Hagert CG. Anatomical studies on the geometry and stability of the distal radio ulnar joint. Scand J Plast Reconstr Surg 1985;19(1):17-25]. Due to its incongruent articulation, the DRUJ relies strongly on the surrounding soft tissues for stability. The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is generally accepted as the major soft tissue stabilizer of the DRUJ of which the volar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments are the primary components. Restoration of the radioulnar ligaments offers the best possibility to restore the normal DRUJ primary constraints and kinematics. This article presents an update of the procedure developed by the senior author that anatomically reconstructs the palmar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments at their anatomic origins and insertions.","Hand (New York, N.Y.)",18780072,2008
Scaphoid excision with four-corner fusion: a biomechanical study.,"PURPOSE: Partial wrist arthrodesis is a commonly performed procedure for the treatment of posttraumatic wrist arthritis because of its ability to provide pain relief without sacrificing complete wrist motion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the redistribution of force after four-corner fusion and scaphoid excision, and to correlate the findings with the reported clinical outcomes.METHODS: Fifteen cadaveric wrists were used to study the biomechanics of the four-corner fusion. Pressure-sensitive film (super-low-pressure-indicating film-Pressurex, Sensor Products Inc, Madison, NJ) was inserted into the radiocarpal joint. Using the MTS 858 Mini Bionix (MTS System, Eden Prairie, MN), 50-kg loads (220 N) were applied to the wrists before and after simulated four-corner fusion and scaphoid excision. Statistically, we compared the pressure in the normal (intact) wrists versus four-corner fusion and scaphoid excision. The pressure measurements across the scaphoid fossa, lunate fossa, and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) were compared.RESULTS: There is a statistical significant difference between scaphoid, lunate, and TFCC mean total force when pre and post-fusion were compared (p = 0.0001). Our study revealed a statistical significant decrease in the mean scaphoid total force after scaphoid excision and four-corner fusion (p = 0.0001). We also found a subsequent increase in mean total force after scaphoid excision and four-corner fusion for the lunate fossa that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08), and no difference in load across the TFCC area (p = 0.995).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that load is preferentially transferred to the radiolunate joint after scaphoid excision with four-corner fusion.","Hand (New York, N.Y.)",18780052,2008
Diagnostic comparison of 1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla preoperative MRI of the wrist in patients with ulnar-sided wrist pain.,"PURPOSE: The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 1.5 Tesla (T) and of 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are correlated with wrist arthroscopy findings in patients presenting with ulnar-sided wrist pain.METHODS: The records and diagnostic MRI scans of 102 patients who presented between 1997 and 2006 with ulnar-sided wrist pain were evaluated. Preoperative MRI scans at 1.5T (n = 70) and 3.0T (n = 32) were evaluated by 2 experienced musculoskeletal radiologists with different levels of experience who were blinded to the arthroscopic findings. Preoperative MRI findings for the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), scapholunate, ulnotriquetral, and lunotriquetral ligaments were recorded and compared with findings at diagnostic arthroscopy. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for both the 1.5T and 3.0T preoperative MRI scans. Statistical comparisons were made using chi-square test and JMP 6.0 software.RESULTS: A tear of the TFCC was identified retrospectively on 1.5T images in 49 of 58 patients and on 3.0T images in 15 of 16 patients. Compared with the gold standard of arthroscopy, 1.5T wrist MRI in this patient population had a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 75%, and an accuracy of 83% for reader 1 for the detection of a tear of the TFCC. In the same patient population, 3.0T wrist MRI had a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 88%, and an accuracy of 91% for reader 1. For reader 2, the improvement in sensitivity for the lunotriquetral ligament between the 1.5T and 3.0T images was statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 3.0T wrist MRI for the TFCC is consistently higher compared with those of 1.5T wrist MRI. The trend suggests that 3.0T wrist MRI provides improved capability for detection of TFCC injuries. Given the available sample size, however, the confidence intervals around the point estimates are wide and overlapping. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute our results of the estimated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy parameters.",The Journal of hand surgery,18762112,2008
An analysis of causes and treatment outcome of chronic wrist pain after distal radial fractures.,"Healed distal radial fractures are frequently complicated by chronic wrist pain which is multifactorial and can be debilitating. An accurate delineation of the pathoanatomy is the key for successful treatment. This study reviewed 22 patients who had surgical treatment between 1997 and 2001 for chronic wrist pain after distal radial fracture. Four patterns of pathoanatomy were identified: (1) ulnar impaction caused by radial malunion and shortening; (2) ulnar styloid non-union; (3) triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears with or without distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability; and (4) intercarpal ligament injuries and chondral lesions. Surgical treatment directed towards identified abnormalities gave satisfactory outcome. At six months after surgery the mean functional score improved 36%, mean pain score decreased 50%, mean grip strength improved 25%, and 64% of patients returned to work.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,18711777,2008
[Wrist stability after experimental traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions].,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the changes in stability of the wrist after experimental traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions, and to provide basic theoretical criteria for clinical treatment.METHODS: Fourteen adult cadaver upper extremities specimens were included. Two of 14 specimens were tested in pre-experiment. The specimens were tested in a INSTRON 8874 biomechanics measuring instrument. First a dorsal arthrotomy (ART) was performed, and second test was with 1 of 4 different experimental lesions according to Palmer's classification of traumatic TFCC lesions (n=3). 1A: central perforation; 1B: ulnar avulsion with or without fracture of processus styloideus ulnae; 1C: distal avulsion with ligament injury; 1D: radial avulsion. Forced internal external rotation torque were recorded in the interval -60 degrees to 60 degrees of flexion.RESULTS: The average torque of the dorsal ART was (0.713 +/- 0.121) Nm, and the 1B-1 lesion (ulnar avulsion without ulnar styloid fracture) was (0.709 +/- 0.134) Nm, the 1B-2 lesion (ulnar avulsion with ulnar styloid fracture) was (0.409 +/- 0.113) Nm. The difference between the 1B-1 lesion and the dorsal ART was not significant but the difference between the 1B-2 lesion and the dorsal ART was significant (P &lt; 0.05). The average torque of the 1C lesion in about 45 degrees of wrist extension and flexion were (0.878 +/- 0.184) Nm and (0.988 +/- 0.197) Nm, and the dorsal ART were (1.510 +/- 0.173) Nm and (1.540 +/- 0.093) Nm. The difference between the two groups was significant (P &lt; 0.05). The 1A lesion and 1D lesion did not alter significantly wrist stability.CONCLUSION: The 1B-2 lesion and 1C lesion alter significantly the stability of the wrist.",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,18681282,2008
Clinical comparison of arthroscopic versus open repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears treated by arthroscopic repair have improved functional outcome scores, range of motion, grip strength, and pain relief compared with those repaired using an open surgical technique.METHODS: From 1997 to 2006, 75 patients had repair of traumatic TFCC tears. Thirty-six patients had arthroscopic TFCC repair, and 39 patients had open repair. One patient was lost to follow-up. Evaluation included range of motion, grip strength, preoperative and postoperative Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), and patient-reported Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score and visual analog scale score. Data were analyzed using chi-square tests or 2-sample t-tests; significance was set at p &lt; .05.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 43 months +/- 11. Mean MMWS improved 6.5 points +/- 19.9 after surgery. Fifty-seven percent of patients improved at least 1 level in the MMWS pain score. No statistical difference was found between open and arthroscopic repair in the improvement of MMWS or visual analog scale pain scores. There was increased postoperative nerve pain (ulnar nerve branch) in the open group (14 out of 39 patients) compared with the arthroscopic group (8 out of 36 patients), but this was not found to be statistically significant. Reoperation for distal radioulnar joint instability was performed in 17% of patients. No statistical association was observed between surgery type and the rate of reoperation for instability. Female gender was significantly associated with a higher rate of total reoperation.CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistical difference in clinical outcomes after open versus arthroscopic TFCC repair. Although not statistically significant, there was an increased rate of postoperative superficial ulnar nerve pain in the open group (14 out of 39 patients) compared with the arthroscopic group (8 out of 36 patients). After TFCC repair, 13 out of 75 patients required reoperation for distal radioulnar joint instability in this sample. A statistically significant association was found between reoperation rate and female gender.",The Journal of hand surgery,18590850,2008
The value of plain X-rays in predicting TFCC injury after distal radial fractures.,"In this prospective study, the plain X-rays and MRI scans of 60 patients with intraarticular distal radius fractures were examined in random order. MRI evaluation revealed that 27 of the 60 patients (45%) had triangular fibrocartilage lesions. No correlation was found between triangular fibrocartilage injury and the Melone classification system, the presence of an ulnar styloid fracture, comminution of the articular surface of the distal radius, &gt;20 degrees dorsal angulation of the distal radius or subluxation/dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint on the plain X-rays. When Frykman Type VI and VIII fractures were compared with all the other Frykman subtypes, a significant difference in the incidence of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears was observed. We conclude that triangular fibrocartilage injury should be considered with all distal radial fractures, especially the Frykman Types VI and VIII.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",18562365,2008
Management of acute triangular fibrocartilage complex injury of the wrist.,"Acute trauma to the triangular fibrocartilage complex includes tears of the fibrocartilage articular disk substance and meniscal homolog as well as radioulnar ligament avulsions, with or without an associated fracture. Patient evaluation includes clinical examination, imaging studies, and wrist arthroscopy (diagnostic). The Palmer classification is typically used to define injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex. The critical distinction is in differentiating injuries that produce instability of the distal radioulnar joint from those that do not. Also important is the recognition of acute injuries in the context of an ongoing degenerative pattern (ie, Palmer class 2 lesions). Nonsurgical management includes temporary splint immobilization of the wrist and forearm, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, corticosteroid joint injection, and physical therapy. Surgical strategies include débridement, acute repair, and subacute repair. Most surgical procedures can be performed arthroscopically. However, open ligament repair may be needed in the setting of distal radioulnar joint instability.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,18524983,2008
Meniscus and discus lesions of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC): treatment by laser-assisted wrist arthroscopy.,"BACKGROUND: Meniscus and disc lesions in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are generally caused by falling accidents with pronated, hyperextended wrists, or by distraction injuries that pull the ulnar side of the wrist out of place. Characteristic clinical signs are swelling and pain in the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) and a 'clicking' noise in the meniscus lesion. If untreated, loss of mobility and grip strength as well as progressive arthritic changes ensue. We investigated in this study the laser-assisted arthroscopic debridement of the central TFCC and meniscus to compare the advantages and disadvantages of such treatment to conventional arthroscopic debridement.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-two patients underwent laser-assisted arthroscopic debridement of traumatic TFCC tears (meniscus and disc). Patients with TFCC tears that were associated with fractures, significant bone or neurovascular pathology or DRUJ instability were excluded from the study. The mean age was 32.4 years; 28 female and 51 male patients were included in the study. The mean follow up was 25.6 months. First of all, we evaluated the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. We then applied the range of motion of the hand (ROM) as second variable during statistical analysis to identify outcome.RESULTS: There were no complications after surgery. No instabilities or dislocations of the DRUJ were noted. The postoperative DASH score indicated that the laser-assisted arthroscopic repair of traumatic peripheral TFCC tears resulted in a very good functional outcome. All patients with isolated meniscus homologue tears were without pain after the operation. At final follow up, the ROM was equal to or greater than that of the contralateral side.CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the TFCC laser debridement technique is easy and safe to perform. The outcome was excellent with less pain and good ROM. In particular, the laser technique enabled a good intra-articular haemostasis and allowed an exact tear debridement.","Journal of plastic, reconstructive &amp; aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",18468968,2008
Incidence of dorsal radiocarpal ligament tears in the presence of other intercarpal derangements.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of dorsal radiocarpal ligament (DRCL) tears in patients who underwent wrist arthroscopy for chronic pain.METHODS: A chart review was performed of 64 patients who underwent diagnostic wrist arthroscopy for wrist pain. Interosseous ligament instability/tears were graded according to the Geissler classification. Tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and other intracarpal pathology were documented. Any DRCL tears were noted.RESULTS: The average duration of wrist pain before arthroscopy was 20 months. There were 35 of 64 patients with DRCL tears. The average duration of wrist pain before treatment was 20 months (range, 4 to 60 months). There were 5 patients who had an isolated DRCL tear. Thirteen patients in this series had a scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) derangement; 7 of 13 also had a DRCL tear. Seven patients had a lunotriquetral interosseous ligament (LTIL) derangement; 2 of 7 also had a DRCL tear. Two patients had a capitohamate ligament tear; 1 of these patients also had a DRCL tear. There were 7 patients with a solitary TFCC tear; 6 of 7 were in association with a DRCL tear. One patient had a chronic ulnar styloid nonunion and a DRCL tear. Two or more lesions were present in 23 patients; DRCL tears were present in 12 of 23 patients. Three patients had generalized arthrofibrosis; 1 had a volar ganglion and 2 had a normal examination. None of these were associated with DRCL tears.CONCLUSIONS: DRCL tears are commonly seen with injuries to the SLIL, the LTIL, and the TFCC. Isolated DRCL tears should be treated with an arthroscopic repair. DRCL repairs in the presence of other intracarpal pathologies requires further study.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,18442684,2008
Incidence and distribution of blood vessels in punch biopsies of Palmer 1A disc lesions in the wrist.,"INTRODUCTION: Although the partial excision of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears appears to be a clinically effective technique, little is known about the ability of the central disc tears to heal. Unlike peripheral tears, central tears do not have immediate access to blood supply. The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence and distribution of blood vessels in punch biopsies of symptomatic central TFCC tissue. In addition, the study investigated if arthroscopic debridement can reach vascularized tissue to enable a reparative response of the tear.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with symptomatic central traumatic tears in the TFCC (Palmer 1A) were included in this study. The cartilage was debrided arthroscopically using a biopsy punch. The debrided tissue was then examined histologically. To visualize blood vessels, the histological sections were stained with CD 31 antibodies. The presence/absence of blood vessels was recorded on a qualitative level.RESULTS: In six patients, five or more blood vessels (CD31 positive endothelial cells) could be detected. In eight patients, fewer than five vessels could be found in the periphery of the slides. In 18 patients no vessels could be identified. The incidence of vessels in the outer region was higher than in the inner region of the peripheral area. There was no correlation found between the time of trauma and incidence of blood vessels (P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: Only in 43% of arthroscopic debridements of Palmer 1A tears vascularized tissue could be reached.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,18437402,2008
The incidence of dorsal radiocarpal ligament tears in patients having diagnostic wrist arthroscopy for wrist pain.,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to examine the incidence of dorsal radiocarpal ligament (DRCL) tears in patients having diagnostic arthroscopy for chronic wrist pain.METHODS: A chart review was performed of 64 patients who had diagnostic wrist arthroscopy for chronic wrist pain that was refractory to conservative measures. For each case, interosseous ligament instability/tears were graded according to the Geissler classification. Tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and the presence or absence of a DRCL tear were noted.RESULTS: There were 35 of 64 wrists (in 64 patients) with DRCL tears. The average duration of wrist pain prior to treatment was 20 months. Only 10 patients could recall a specific injury. Five patients had an isolated DRCL tear. A scapholunate interosseous ligament injury was identified in 13 patients, of whom 7 had a concomitant DRCL tear. A lunotriquetral interosseous ligament injury was present in 7 patients, of whom 2 had a concomitant DRCL tear. Two patients had a capitohamate ligament tear: 1 of these patients had a DRCL tear. There were 7 patients with a solitary triangular fibrocartilage complex tear: 6 of 7 were in association with a DRCL tear. One patient had a chronic ulnar styloid nonunion and a DRCL tear. Two or more lesions were present in 23 patients; DRCL tears were present in 12.CONCLUSIONS: DRCL tears are commonly seen with injuries to the primary wrist stabilizers. Recognition of this condition and further research into treatment methods are needed.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,18343287,2008
Correlation of ulnar length and apoptotic cell death in degenerative lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate apoptosis in degenerative disc lesions (Palmer type IIC) and differentiate between patients with ulna-plus and ulna-neutral variance.METHODS: Seventeen patients with degenerative tears (Palmer type IIC) in the articular disc of the triangular fibrocartilage were included in this study. The triangular fibrocartilage was debrided arthroscopically with a punch and the histologic sections were used to analyze necrosis and apoptosis. Apoptosis and necrosis was quantified by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Apoptotic cells were visualized by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) p85 immunohistochemistry. The number of apoptotic and necrotic cells was then correlated with ulnar length.RESULTS: PARP- and TUNEL-positive cells were found in each patient. In addition, patients with an ulna plus variance showed a significantly increased number of apoptotic cells in comparison to patients with an ulna neutral variance. The distribution of the apoptosis-positive cells did not show any accumulation in the inner part of the specimen, but were evenly distributed.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that patients with ulna plus present with significantly higher numbers of apoptotic cells in degenerative lesions in comparison to patients with ulna neutral. The apoptotic cells were evenly distributed throughout the entire specimen.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of this study revealed that increased length of the ulna is related to increased cell death. Therefore, techniques that decrease the ulna variance would appear to be appropriate and would improve the clinical situation by preventing further cell death.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,18308181,2008
Reconstruction of essex-lopresti injury of the forearm: technical note.,"Longitudinal instability of the forearm resulting from an Essex-Lopresti injury is a surgical challenge, and no technique has yet met universal success. A new technique is presented here consisting of reconstruction of the radial head, leveling of the distal radioulnar joint, reconstruction of the central band of the interosseous membrane by using a pronator teres rerouting technique, and finally repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. It is hoped that by addressing all of the contributing longitudinal stabilizing structures, the longitudinal instability of the forearm will be controlled.

Sonography and sonoarthrography of the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage disk: initial experience and correlation with arthrography and magnetic resonance arthrography.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of sonography and sonoarthrography in evaluation of dorsal bands of the scapholunate ligament (SLL), lunotriquetral ligament (LTL), and triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) disk in correlation with arthrography and magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA).METHODS: High-resolution sonography of the SLL, LTL, and TFC disk was performed on symptomatic wrists in 16 patients referred by a hand surgeon for MRA of the symptomatic wrists. All patients then underwent arthrography and an MRA study of the same wrist. After MRA, sonography was repeated. The imaging findings of these different techniques were then compared. Four patients (25%) underwent surgery of their wrists. In these 4 patients, the surgical and imaging findings were correlated.RESULTS: For the SLL, the results were concordant for all imaging modalities in 15 patients (93.75%) and partially concordant in 1 (6.25%). For the LTL, the results were concordant for all imaging modalities in 12 patients (75%), partially concordant in 3 (18.75%), and discordant in 1 (6.25%). For the TFC disk, the results were concordant for all imaging modalities in 13 patients (81.25%), partially concordant in 2 (12.5%), and discordant in 1 (6.25%). The arthroscopic and imaging findings were concordant for 3 SLLs, 3 LTLs, and 3 TFC disks.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results are encouraging. Sonography may be used at least as a screening imaging modality in evaluation of the SLL and TFC disk.

Arthroscopic visualisation of the distal radioulnar joint.,"The diagnosis of chronic wrist pain is challenging and wrist arthroscopy has been recognised as the &quot;gold standard&quot;. The present study investigated the efficacy of adding distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) arthroscopy to routine wrist arthroscopy. The records of 67 patients who underwent DRUJ arthroscopy were reviewed, and the success rates for visualisation of intra-articular structures were determined. Pathological findings were correlated with ulnar-side wrist pain. In seven patients, pre-operative diagnoses were altered after DRUJ arthroscopy. The ulnar head and proximal surface of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) were visualised in 100% and 99% of patients, respectively, while the foveal insertion of TFCC and sigmoid notch were visualised in 57% and 69%, respectively. Pathological findings of the proximal surface of TFCC tended to relate to ulnar wrist pain (p = 0.06). DRUJ arthroscopy should be included in routine wrist arthroscopy to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,19378356,2008
[Instability from the distal radioulnar joint: reconstruction and evolution of dorsal triangular fibrocartilage complex ligament].,"Dorsal and palmar radio ulnar ligaments are part of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and are the principal stabilizer of this articulation. The distal radio ulnar joint provides not only pronation and supination to the forearm, but also it's basic for strength. The objective of this study is to evaluate the functional results of the dorsal radio ulnar joint ligament reconstruction in patient with distal radio ulnar instability. This is a prospective, longitudinal, experimental and auto-control assay. Functional preoperative data was analyzed, proper surgical technique and another findings. The patients were evaluated with a functional exploration, comparative dynamometry and DASH evaluation, they were also asked about their personal satisfaction. Between 1997 and 2004, this treatment was practiced in eleven patients (2 men and 9 women) with distal radio ulnar joint instability. With a mean age of 34.1 years. The dominant had was involved in 91% of patients. The mean complaint was pain for all patients, weakness in 9 patients and instability in 7.

Resection of comminuted ulna head fragments with soft tissue reconstruction when associated with distal radius fractures.,"Acute management of fractures involving the head and neck of the distal ulna associated with comminuted unstable fractures of the distal radius remains difficult and controversial. Fifteen consecutive such cases treated with combined external and internal fixation together with primary resection of comminuted distal ulna fracture fragments and reconstruction of the periosteal sleeve and triangular fibrocartilaginous complex are reviewed. At an average follow-up of 5.8 years, all patients were assessed for range of motion, strength, pain and function, and radiographic appearance. All had a range of motion postoperatively of at least 85% of the opposite wrist in all planes. Average grip strength was 88.6% of the contralateral wrist. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated no evidence of instability in any plane. There were no cases of subluxation of the distal ulna nor collapse of the ulnar side of the carpus. Those 7 patients studied arthrographically demonstrated an intact &quot;water-tight&quot; ulna-sided soft tissue sling, and all distal radius fractures healed primarily.",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,18090826,2007
A novel technique of all-inside arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex repair.,"Peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears are amenable to repair. Limitations of current repair techniques include prolonged recovery and button or knot intolerance. We present a novel technique of an all-inside repair using existing technology (FasT-Fix; Smith &amp; Nephew Endoscopy, Andover, MA) to circumvent these complications. This technique is faster, easily performed, safe, and potentially stronger than current repairs. Earlier motion and rehabilitation are instituted after this repair. The tear is debrided to stimulate angiogenesis. The FasT-Fix is inserted through the 3-4 portal with the arthroscope in the 6R portal. The first poly-L-lactic acid block is deposited peripheral to the tear. Upon penetration of the wrist capsule, a distinct decrease in resistance is felt. The introducer is withdrawn, depositing the block outside the capsule. The trigger on the introducer advances the second block into the deployment position. It is advanced and deposited central to the tear, forming a vertical mattress configuration. The introducer is removed, leaving the pre-tied suture. The knot is tightened and cut by use of the knot pusher/cutter. Multiple implants may be inserted to complete the repair. Postoperative care involves a sugartong splint for 2 weeks followed by a short arm cast for 4 weeks. Range of motion is begun thereafter with strengthening started at 10 weeks.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,18063183,2007
Dorsoradial avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex with an avulsion fracture of the sigmoid notch of the radius.,We report two extremely rare cases of dorsal radial avulsion injury of the triangular fibrocartilage complex accompanied by an avulsion fracture of the sigmoid notch of the radius. Anatomical reduction of the bone fragment in conjunction with reattachment of the dorsal portion of the radioulnar ligament to the radial sigmoid notch were necessary to restore stability of the distal radioulnar joint and tension of the triangular fibrocartilage proper.,"The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",17993436,2007
The pathology of the long ulna: anatomy and treatment.,"A long ulna, as a result of congenital differential growth, such as Madelung's disease, or injury, commonly a consequence of a malunited distal radial fracture, may present clinically as pain, decreased motion, mainly of pronosupination, and weakness of grip. Secondary effects may include perforations and tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, cartilage wear of the proximal surface of lunate and triquetrum and tears of the lunotriquetral ligament. Positive ulnar variance may be evident on X-rays but a prominent ulnar head cannot always be excluded when there is neutral ulnar variance and further investigations, such as an arthroCTscan or arthroscopy, may be necessary. The two principle treatment options are (a) resection of the distal ulna (Darrach's and Sauvé-Kapandji's techniques are commonly used) and (b) techniques preserving the ulnar head, including different modalities of shortening osteotomy. The aim is to regain a congruent distal radioulnar joint, restore painless and normal pronosupination and prevent onset of osteoarthritis of this joint.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",17993420,2007
Degeneration process of symptomatic central tears in the triangular fibrocartilage.,"Very little is known about the degeneration or healing process in traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions. Forty-two patients with symptomatic central traumatic tears in the TFCC (Palmer 1 A) were included in this study. The cartilage was debrided arthroscopically and used for histologic examination. Histologic sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and furthermore, with collagen I and II antibodies. The histologic findings were compared with degenerative findings in 12 patients with degenerative TFCC (Palmer 2 C) lesions. In patients with recent trauma (&lt;18 months), we mostly found no degenerative changes or only moderate changes, located in the inner part of the tissue. In patients with trauma having occurred more than 18 months ago, the typical degeneration phenomena were mostly extensive and pervasive throughout the entire specimen and similar to our control group (Palmer 2 C). The immunohistochemistry examination showed that in patients having suffered trauma within the last 18 months, the staining for collagen I and II was more intensive than in patients with trauma having occurred more than 18 months ago. The collagen I and II staining in the control group (Palmer 2 C) was weaker, too. Degeneration phenomena can be found in patients with trauma having occurred more than 18 months ago. The degree of degeneration correlated with the length of time passed since the occurrence of trauma.",Annals of plastic surgery,17992144,2007
Ulnar shortening osteotomy for ulnar ideopathic impaction syndrome.,"Twenty-eight patients were treated by ulnar shortening osteotomy for static or dynamic ulnar impaction syndrome. Ulnar variance was measured on a true anteroposterior radiograph. There were 25 wrists that were too long, two neutral, and one that was short. Bones were shortened by a mean of 3.5 mm. Mean follow-up time was 29 months (range 7-60), all with confirmed consolidation. At final follow-up mean grip strength had improved from 67% to 75%, mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score from 40 (range 12-83) to 26 (range 0-61) and mean range of movement from 80% (range 40%-100%) to 88% (range 50%-100%). Smoking, age at operation, type of osteotomy (transverse or oblique), dominance of hand, and sex did not influence consolidation or functionality. Special attention was paid to the anatomy of the distal radioulnar joint and the inclination of the sigmoid notch of the radius. There was no correlation between the anatomy and the functional outcome scores. Mean consolidation time (10 months) (range 2-32) and return to work were longer than in similar studies. Our findings confirm the usefulness of ulnar shortening osteotomy in the relief of ulnocarpal impingement symptoms.",Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery,17952805,2007
All-inside suture technique for Palmer class 1B triangular fibrocartilage repair.,"After completion of the diagnostic procedure, the ulnar-sided tear is identified and tear debridement is performed. A 1.5-cm incision is made to isolate the sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. This is made in the region of the 6U portal. The arthroscope is left in the 3-4 portal, and the slotted needle is inserted through the capsule wall, avoiding the isolated sensory ulnar branch, penetrating the ulnar-sided tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. A No. 2 PDS monofilament suture (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) is inserted into the needle and visualized in the joint. The end of the suture is pulled through the 6R portal. The slotted needle is then removed and detached from the suture. The same needle is inserted through the tear about 0.3 cm from the point where the needle exited on the previous suture. The other end of the suture is inserted into the needle, and once visualized within the joint, it is withdrawn again through the 6R portal. In this way, we create an extra-articular loop with both ends of the same suture passing through the tear by way of the 6R portal. A knot is then tied and fixed inside the joint on the ulnar side of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. By use of the same technique, 2 or 3 more stitches can be placed, improving tear security.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,17916483,2007
Factors affecting results of ulnar shortening for ulnar impaction syndrome.,"Although ulnar shortening osteotomy is the most frequently performed operation for ulnar impaction syndrome, little attention has been given to detect certain preoperative factors affecting clinical outcomes of this procedure. We asked whether preoperative factors influenced the postoperative score of ulnar shortening osteotomy combined with arthroscopic debridement of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. We retrospectively reviewed 51 patients (53 wrists) with ulnar impaction syndrome treated with this procedure. There were 28 males and 23 females ranging in age from 14 to 67 years (mean, 37.5 years). The minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 26.3 months; range, 12-95 months). At last followup, we determined a modified Mayo wrist score for each patient. Preoperative factors affecting the clinical score were identified using multiple regression analysis. The clinical score ranged from 40 to 100 points (mean, 84.5 points). A long duration of symptoms and workers' compensation predicted worse clinical scores. We recommend considering these two factors when deciding whether to perform this procedure.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,17906587,2007
[Trauma to the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC)].,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) can be injured either due to trauma or by chronic strain. Based on these findings, Palmer devised a classification system distinguishing traumatic (I) and degenerative (II) TFCC lesions. Traumatic TFCC injury may be single or involved in a combined injury of the distal radius. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of surgical treatment in patients with traumatic TFCC injury at six-month follow-up.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the years 2000 to 2004, 23 patients with injury to the wrist were treated. The group comprised 16 men and 7 women at an average age of 34 years (range, 17 to 54 years). Nine patients were diagnosed with a distal radial fracture and 14 had no damage to the bony structures. Of these, seven showed clinical signs of TFCC injury and were indicated to acute arthroscopy of the wrist. The remaining seven, due to persisting complaints, were examined by arthroscopy within 3 months of injury. During the arthroscopic procedure, the Palmer type of injury was identified and arthroscopic treatment, open or closed, was carried out at the same stage. All patients were followed up for 6 months for pain relief and return to full physical activity.RESULTS: The arthroscopic examination revealed the following TFCC lesions: 11 central ruptures (I.A), 6 ulnar tears (I.B), 4 palmar (I.C) and 2 radial (I.D) avulsions. During arthroscopy, partial resection of the disc was performed in 13 cases (I.A, I.D), and reattachment of the disc to the styloid process of the ulna was carried out in six cases (I.B). In four of these patients the intervention was done at the stage of acute lesion within 4 weeks of injury, and in two within a longer period. Four patients with type I.C injuries underwent open disc reattachment from the palmar approach. Subjective evaluation showed that 65 % of the patients had no complaints, 26 % reported pain after excessive activity and 9 % had pain associated with daily activities. Nome of the patients reported rest pain.DISCUSSION: In our group, 91 % of the patients reported excellent and very good results at six months of follow-up. The two patients experiencing pain in daily activities (9 %) had type I.B. injury and were indicated for arthroscopy at a time longer than 6 weeks after injury.CONCLUSIONS: TFCC lesions are wrist injuries which, if diagnosed early and treated appropriately, show good healing. If the triangular fibrocartilage complex is damaged by a central tear, disc resection gives good results. However, if the distal radioulnar ligaments are torn, their reattachment is necessary in order to prevent instability of the distal radioulnar joint. Open surgical procedures interfere with integrity of the distal radioulnar joint ligaments, which may lead to joint instability and prolonged healing.",Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca,17877942,2007
Magnetic resonance imaging of the triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions: a comprehensive clinicoradiologic approach and review of the literature.,"OBJECTIVE: This article illustrates the frequent lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) by means of magnetic resonance imaging.METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of the magnetic resonance images of 109 patients from our database. All subjects had history of trauma, and all underwent both radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging examination of the wrist. The changes (degeneration, tears) of the TFCC were assessed.RESULTS: Ten patients were excluded because of incomplete imaging protocol (4 patients) and low-quality images (6 patients). From the 99 wrists remaining, the TFCC was normal in 30 (30.3%). Degenerative changes were found in 40 (40.4%) wrists. Partial and complete tears were present in 17 (17.1%) and 12 (12.1%) wrists, respectively.CONCLUSION: The TFCC lesions in acute traumatic wrists should not be overlooked; they may contribute to wrist pain and disability after treatment of existing bone injuries.",Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics,17870421,2007
Innervation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex of the human wrist: quantitative immunohistochemical study.,"The distribution of neural elements in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) of the human wrists was studied via immunohistochemical staining of protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Articular branches projecting to the TFCC arose from the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve in all wrists examined. The TFCC is subdivided into the following six regions: the articular disc proper (ADP), meniscus homolog (MH), radio-ulnar ligament (RUL), loose part of ulnar collateral ligament (lUCL), dense part of ulnar collateral ligament (dUCL), and internal portion (IP). The IP consists of a mixture of dense and loose connective tissues enclosed by the ADP, MH, RUL, and UCL, and resides deep in the prestyloid recess, which is a pit in the MH. The densities of PGP 9.5-positive neural elements, including free nerve endings, single nerve fibers, nerve fascicles, and perivascular neural nets, were significantly higher in the IP than in other regions. Some of the neural elements except for the perivascular neural nets were positive for CGRP. The high density of neural elements in the IP suggests that sensory nerves projecting to the TFCC enter into the IP and from there distribute to adjacent regions such as the MH and RUL. Free nerve endings are responsible for pain transmission. The high density of free nerve endings in the IP suggests that the IP is a source of ulnar side wrist pain.",Anatomical science international,17867338,2007
Study of ulnar variance with high-resolution MRI: correlation with triangular fibrocartilage complex and cartilage of ulnar side of wrist.,"PURPOSE: To investigate correlations with ulnar variance and the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) or cartilage of ulnar side of the wrist on high-resolution MRI with a microscopy coil.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed ulnar variance, TFCC, and cartilage of the ulnar side of the wrist in 93 subjects (29 asymptomatic volunteers and 64 patients with suspected TFCC injury) with high-resolution MRI using a 47-mm microscopy surface coil. All MR images were obtained with a 1.5 T scanner. Coronal 2D gradient recalled echo T(2)*-weighted images were used for analysis. For qualitative analysis we measured ulnar variance, TFCC angle, thickness in the central portion of TFCC disc proper, and cartilage thickness of the lunate and the ulnar head on MRI and calculated the correlation coefficient between measured values. We also examined the relationship between ulnar variance and age or sex.RESULTS: High-resolution MR images clearly demonstrated TFCC and cartilage of the wrist and ulnar variance. The mean ulnar variance on MRI was +0.26 mm (range, -4.59 to +3.71 mm). The mean TFCC angle and TFCC thickness were 23.9 degrees (range, -4.6 to +54.1 degrees ) and 1.11 mm (range, 0.4 to 3.22 mm), respectively. Ulnar variance and TFCC angle were positively correlated (r = 0.84), and ulnar variance and TFCC thickness were negatively correlated (r = -0.71). However, ulnar variance and lunate or ulnar head cartilage thickness were not significantly correlated.CONCLUSION: High-resolution MRI with a microscopy coil is a useful tool for evaluating the relationship between ulnar variance and ulnar side structures.",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,17729368,2007
High-resolution MRI of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) at 3T: comparison of surface coil and volume coil.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate high-resolution MRI of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) at 3T using a surface coil (SC) or volume coil (VC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI was obtained from nine volunteers in the supine position with a 3-inch SC and in prone position with a transmit-receiver wrist VC at 3 T. Coronal two-dimensional-gradient echo (2D-GRE) images (TR/TE/FA = 500 msec/15 msec/40 degrees , 1 mm slice-thickness, 60 mm field of view [FOV], 192 x 256 matrix) and coronal 3D-GRE images (TR/TE/FA = 33 msec/15 msec/10 degrees , 0.8 mm slice-thickness, 80 mm FOV, 256 x 256 matrix) were used. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the TFCC and surrounding structures were measured. For qualitative measurement, visualization of TFCC and intercarpal ligaments was graded.RESULTS: SNR of TFCC, cartilage, and bone marrow on 2D-GRE with SC/VC was as follows: 5.3/5.3 (TFCC), 16.5/14.4 (cartilage), and 3.61/3.96 (bone marrow). 3D-GRE showed similar SNR. Cartilage-TFCC/cartilage-bone marrow CNR were 11.1/12.8 (SC-2D-GRE), 8.8/10.5 (VC-2D-GRE), 14.1/15.5 (SC-3D-GRE), and 11.9/15.0 (VC-3D-GRE). Quantitative values were not significantly different between SC and VC. Visualization of TFCC and intercarpal ligament with SC was superior to that with VC. All structures show higher scores with 3D-GRE imaging compared to 2D-GRE imaging.CONCLUSION: SC may provide superior qualitative and quantitative results and can be an alternative in case of difficulty in prone position at 3T.",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,17729361,2007
Arthroscopic all-inside repair of Palmer type 1B triangular fibrocartilage complex tears: a technical note.,"Arthroscopic repair of peripheral dorso-ulnar triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions is now a preferred method. Both outside-in and inside-out techniques are commonly performed for repairing Palmer type 1B TFCC tear. But these techniques have disadvantages of making an additional skin incision to tie knots subcutaneously over the capsule. We performed an arthroscopic all-inside repair technique of Palmer type 1B TFCC tears, which is a modified method of the outside-in technique using a spinal needle. This all-inside technique is as simple as previously described arthroscopic techniques and also has advantages of vertical mattress suture and no additional incision. We recommend this technique as a useful alternative to the others for repairing Palmer type 1B TFCC tear.","Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA",17668185,2007
Cross-sectional imaging of internal derangement of the wrist with arthroscopic correlation.,"Wrist arthroscopy has become an indispensable tool for the surgeon treating internal derangement of the wrist. The role of arthroscopy in both the diagnosis and treatment of intrinsic ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) pathology is well established. Arthroscopy remains a surgical procedure with potential complications, and it does not obviate the need for a careful history, physical examination, and conventional radiography. When the diagnosis remains unclear after these initial investigations, cross-sectional imaging studies play a valuable role in the assessment of internal derangement of the wrist. These studies include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA), and computed tomography arthrography (CTA), the choice of which depends on the specific clinical query. The radiologist must have exact knowledge of the performance of each diagnostic test to select the appropriate one and interpret it in a clinically relevant manner. With continued refinements in the technological aspects of cross-sectional imaging, its potential to replace diagnostic arthroscopy will surely be realized in the near future. This article focuses on the role of cross-sectional imaging and arthroscopy in the evaluation and management of wrist internal derangement, namely of intrinsic ligaments and TFCC pathology.",Seminars in musculoskeletal radiology,17665349,2007
[Wrist arthroscopy].,"Wrist arthroscopy has found its place in surgeons armamentarium. Since its introduction the value of wrist arthroscopy has been developing. Current indications for wrist arthroscopy include three groups: diagnostic, evaluation (staging) and therapeutic. Arthroscopy allows for establishing correct diagnosis, including possibility for dynamic testing and probing of examined tissues. Some wrist disorders can be staged and qualified for appropriate operative procedure. Number of therapeutic possibilities have been presented by many authors to be performed by arthroscopic technique in wrist. Our material included 41 wrist arthroscopies. 17 arthroscopies were diagnostic, 4 staging and 20 therapeutic. Arthroscopic interventions included: TFCC repair, debridement, synovectomy, ganglion removal. Ultimate value of wrist arthroscopy remains to be established by more long term scientific update. Wrist arthroscopy is attractive instrument in diagnosis and treatment of different wrist disorders.

Arthroscopic repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical results and functional outcomes of patients with peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions repaired by arthroscopic technique and to describe the pathology of dorsal tears of the TFCC, which was not described in Palmer's classification.METHODS: Thirty-five patients with arthroscopic repair of TFCC tears were reviewed. There were 22 males and 13 females. The average age was 33 years (range, 13 to 51 years). The average follow-up was 39 months (range, 4 to 82 months). TFCC tears were classified by the Palmer classification as follows: IB (11), IC (5), and ID (1). The remaining 18 were not classified according to the Palmer classification. Functional results were evaluated using the ADL (activities of daily living) score and the Modified Mayo Wrist Score.RESULTS: A dorsal peripheral tear found in 18 wrists does not fulfill the Palmer classification of traumatic TFCC injuries. Seventy-four percent of patients had reduction in pain after surgery, with improvement in grip strength and daily activities (P &lt; .05). The Modified Mayo Wrist score was excellent in 54%, good in 20%, fair in 12%, and poor in 14%. Nineteen of 28 working patients returned to their original work. Ulnar nerve dorsal branch neuritis occurred in 17%. A &quot;second-look&quot; arthroscopy was performed on 9 patients with healing shown in 7. Additional procedures were performed on 10 patients (29%) to improve functional outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic repair of peripheral TFCC tears can provide satisfactory results. Seventy-four percent of our patients achieved good to excellent results, had significant pain relief, had increased grip strength, and had an increased capacity to perform daily activities. The Palmer classification does not completely classify all peripheral TFCC tears.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,17637408,2007
A comparison of CT arthrography of the wrist to findings during wrist arthroscopy.,"PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy of computed tomography after wrist arthrogram (CT arthrogram) compared with findings during wrist arthroscopy as interpreted by a musculoskeletal radiologist and a board-certified hand surgeon.METHODS: Seventy-six consecutive patients who had a wrist CT arthrogram and subsequent wrist arthroscopy were identified in the arthroscopic database of four hand surgeons working at a single institution between 2001 and 2006. Operative findings were obtained from the medical record. A single, blinded, musculoskeletal fellowship-trained radiologist prospectively read all CT arthrograms focusing on the following areas: scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL), lunotriquetral interosseous ligament (LTIL), peripheral and central triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), and chondral surfaces. Computed tomography arthrograms were also read in a blinded, prospective fashion by a single hand surgeon. The results of both readings were compared with the findings at the time of wrist arthroscopy.RESULTS: Sixteen SLIL tears, 29 LTIL tears, 10 peripheral TFCC tears, and 33 central TFCC tears were identified at the time of wrist arthroscopy. Sensitivity and specificity of the CT arthrogram were calculated using arthroscopy findings as our reference standard. The radiologist's readings (sensitivity, specificity) revealed the following: SLIL (94%, 86%), LTIL (85%, 79%), peripheral TFCC (30%, 94%), and central TFCC (88%, 95%). Results of CT arthrogram readings by the hand surgeon were SLIL (94%, 82%), LTIL (97%, 81%), peripheral TFCC (40%, 97%), and central TFCC (91%, 85%).CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography arthrogram of the wrist is highly accurate at detecting SLIL, LTIL, and central TFCC tears with high sensitivity and specificity. It is not as accurate at identifying peripheral tears.",The Journal of hand surgery,17606063,2007
Interosseous ligaments and TFCC lesions in intraarticular distal radius fractures - radiographic versus arthroscopic evaluation.,"Background. Intraarticular distal radius fractures are marked by a significant amount of soft tissue damage, which is not always noticed on routine X-rays. The lack of early diagnosis and treatment of these lesions can lead to the development of carpal instability, and subsequently to limited range of motion or wrist pain syndrome. The purpose of this article is to show how these lesions can be diagnosed arthroscopically, and at the same time to compare arthroscopic evaluation to standard X-rays. Material and methods. In the period from August 2004 to April 2005 we performed 21 wrist arthroscopies in 20 patients with intraarticular distal radius fractures (7 women and 13 men, ranging in age from 20 to 63 years, average age 38). Results. In all these patients, numerous soft tissue lesions were found during arthroscopic examination: TFCC lesions in 13 patients, SL ligament lesions in 7 patients, and an LT ligament lesion in 1 case. None of these lesions were visible in X-rays. An ulnar styloid fracture was found in 9 cases, in 4 cases associated with TFCC lesions. Loose bodies, not seen in previous X-rays, were detected in 8 patients. Conclusions. Arthroscopy in intraarticular distal radius fractures facilitates the diagnosis and treatment of soft tissue lesions, which are numerous and usually not detected on standard X-rays.","Ortopedia, traumatologia, rehabilitacja",17592404,2007
Treatment of injury of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).,"Background. The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) supplies stability and cushioning for proper wrist function. TFCC lesions, a common cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain, can be traumatic (Palmer I) or degenerative (Palmer II) in nature. Clinical assessment is basic for making the diagnosis, but imaging may be helpful. Conservative treatment is the best choice for most acute cases. If the symptoms persist, however, operative treatment has a better prognosis for pain relief. Wrist arthroscopy has a major role to play in the diagnosis and treatment of TFCC lesions. Material and methods. 29 patients were operated in the Hand Surgery Department in Poznań due to TFCC lesions. 16 patients were qualified as Palmer type I (9 sport injuries, 7 sprains). while 13 patients had Palmer type II secondary to distal radial fractures. All patients suffered ulnar wrist pain and were positive on provocation tests. The indication for surgery was a lack of response to conservative treatment. Different operative procedures were used, depending on the type of lesion: arthroscopic debridement, open or arthroscopic restabilization of the TFCC, ulnar shortening, or partial resection of the ulnar head (Wafer). Rehabilitation was introduced following a period of immobilization. Results. Wrist pain was significantly diminished or disappeared after surgical treatment and rehabilitation. Conclusions. Good functional result and pain relief can be expected following surgical treatment of TFCC injuries.","Ortopedia, traumatologia, rehabilitacja",17592403,2007
Instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ): a description of the problem and own experience.,"Introduction. The distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is important for rotation of the forearm and stability of the ulnar wrist. Any DRUJ injury can cause limitation of the range of motion, decreased strength, pain, and instability. This paper deals with DRUJ instability, and reviews treatment methods and outcome. Disturbances in DRUJ stability result from bone damage, TFCC and ligament injuries, and/or other soft tissue deficiencies (capsule, tendon). Instability due to injury may be acute or chronic in nature. Most acute cases are best treated conservatively. Chronic problems resulting in disability may require surgical treatment. Material and methods. We studied 7 patients (age 23-55) with DRUJ instability, operated in our Department between 2000 and 2004. The patients were qualified for surgery based on a clinical examination supported by imaging techniques. All were traumatic cases, and three had a history of distal radius fracture. Different operative procedures were used due to the variety of clinical presentations: extraarticular ligament reconstruction acc. to Bunnel-Boys, anatomic ligament reconstruction with PL acc. to Adams, restabilization of TFCC, retinacular reconstruction, and capsular duplication. Results. Pain was significantly decreased in all patients. The range of motion postoperatively did not differ compared to preoperative findings. DRUJ stability was restored in all cases. Conclusions. DRUJ instability can result in significant disability. In such cases surgical treatment restores stability and decreases symptoms. Return to preinjury activities is possible following treatment.","Ortopedia, traumatologia, rehabilitacja",17592402,2007
Suture welding for arthroscopic repair of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"This report presents a method of arthroscopic repair of the peripheral triangular fibrocartilage tears by using ultrasonic suture welding technique, thus avoiding the need for traditional suture knots. This technique eliminates the potential causes of ulnar-sided wrist discomfort especially during the postoperative period. Twenty-three patients (9 women and 14 men; mean age, 35 years; range, 18-52 years) were operated during a 1-year period in 2001 for Palmer grade 1B triangular fibrocartilage complex tear and followed up for 17 months. At the final follow-up, the average wrist arc of motion was as follows: extension, 65 degrees; flexion, 56 degrees; supination, 80 degrees; pronation, 78 degrees; radial deviation, 12 degrees; and ulnar deviation, 25 degrees. Grip strength measured with a dynamometer (Jamar) averaged 81% of the contralateral side at the final evaluation (range, 53%-105%).",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,17536524,2007
An immunohistochemical study of the triangular fibrocartilage complex of the wrist: regional variations in cartilage phenotype.,"The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) transmits load from the wrist to the ulna and stabilizes the distal radioulnar joint. Damage to it is a major cause of wrist pain. Although its basic structure is well established, little is known of its molecular composition. We have analysed the immunohistochemical labelling pattern of the extracellular matrix of the articular disc and the meniscal homologue of the TFCC in nine elderly individuals (age range 69-96 years), using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against collagens, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). Although many of the molecules (types I, III and VI collagen, chondroitin 4 sulphate, dermatan sulphate and keratan sulphate, the oversulphated epitope of chondroitin 6 sulphate, versican and COMP) were found in all parts of the TFCC, aggrecan, link protein and type II collagen were restricted to the articular disc and to entheses. They were thus not a feature of the meniscal homologue. The shift in tissue phenotype within the TFCC, from a fibrocartilaginous articular disc to a more fibrous meniscal homologue, correlates with biomechanical data suggesting that the radial region is stiff and subject to considerable stress concentration. The presence of aggrecan, link protein and type II collagen in the articular disc could explain why the TFCC is destroyed in rheumatoid arthritis, given that it has been suggested that autoimmunity to these antigens results in the destruction of articular cartilage. The differential distribution of aggrecan within the TFCC is likely to be reflected by regional differences in water content and mobility on the radial and ulnar side. This needs to be taken into account in the design of improved MRI protocols for visualizing this ulnocarpal complex of the wrist.",Journal of anatomy,17532798,2007
Detection of apoptotic cartilage cells in symptomatic central tears of the triangular fibrocartilage.,"PURPOSE: Central traumatic injuries of the triangular fibrocartilage are frequent sources of ulnar wrist pain. It is unknown whether the fibrocartilage cells survive this trauma in the central part of the triangular fibrocartilage. The goal of this study was to determine the viability of cells in traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) Palmer 1A lesions to estimate the role of apoptosis for the fate of fibrocartilage cells.METHODS: Twenty-two patients with a symptomatic central traumatic tear in the triangular fibrocartilage were included in this study. The cartilage was debrided arthroscopically, and histologic sections were used for the analysis of cell viability and apoptosis. Cell viability was quantified by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and apoptotic cells were visualized by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) p85 immunohistochemistry. The number of apoptotic cells was correlated with the total number of cells.RESULTS: In contrast with the control patients with only minimal amounts of TUNEL-positive cells, cell viability was markedly reduced in all analyzed patients with TFCC Palmer 1A lesion. Likewise, the number of PARP p85-positive cells was significantly increased in all patients. This indicates that the observed cell death is attributed to apoptosis. Concerning the distribution of apoptotic cells, the inner zone of the biospy showed much higher numbers of apoptotic cells than the outer zone in both PARP and TUNEL staining. In contrast to the analyzed patients, no apoptosis could be detected in the controls.CONCLUSIONS: High amounts of apoptotic cartilage cells could be detected within the inner part of the triangular fibrocartilage suggesting that fibrocartilage cells died in response to trauma and were not quickly replaced by new viable cells. PARP p85-positive cells indicate that the apoptotic cascade plays a crucial role in the TFCC Palmer 1A disorder.",The Journal of hand surgery,17481998,2007
Distal radioulnar joint instability.,"The distal radioulnar joint is inherently unstable. Pathologic instability can be acute or chronic; it can be dorsal, palmar, or multidirectional; and it can result primarily from soft-tissue injury or osseous malunion. Recognition of the type and cause of instability is fundamental to provide effective treatment.",Instructional course lectures,17472295,2007
[MR imaging for the evaluation of accompanying injuries in cases of distal forearm fractures in children and adolescents].,"INTRODUCTION: The study was made to evaluate the role of MR imaging in pediatric distal forearm fractures by comparison with the findings of plain radiographs and MRI.MATERIAL AND METHOD: 38 patients (27 boys and 11 girls, mean age of 12 years, range 7 to 15 years) with radiographically open distal radius and ulna growth plates requiring first aid for a fracture of the distal third of the forearm, were included in this study. The fractures were diagnosed on plain radiographs and conservative treatment was performed. In 35 patients MR imaging was performed within 3 weeks after the accident and in 3 patients MRI was performed after 6 to 9 weeks because of persistent wrist pain.RESULTS: Fifteen Salter/Harris II injuries of the radius and 1 of the ulna, 1 torus fracture of the radius and 2 of the ulna, 12 greenstick fractures of the radius and 3 of the ulna, 10 complete displaced radius fractures and 15 ulnar styloid fractures were found on plain radiographs. Twelve patients had evidence of associated triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions in MRI, there was no statistical correlation between TFCC lesions and fracture types, fracture dislocations or patients age (p &gt; 0.5). One patient had an avulsion of the radioscaphocapitate ligament from the radius accompanying a greenstick fracture of the distal radius. 19 bone bruises and two radiographically occult fractures were identified. In 2 patients, a bone marrow oedema was seen in the radial epiphysis immediately adjacent to the germinal zone of the growth plate. In these patients premature physeal arrest occurred.CONCLUSION: MRI plays an important role in the evaluation of acute pediatric wrist injuries. It allows a better evaluation of osseous lesions than plain radiographs. In our study, a tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex accompanied distal radius fractures in 32 % of patients. Simultaneous rupture of the TFCC insertion in the fovea ulnaris and ulnar styloid fracture lead to destabilisation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ).","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",17402142,2007
Repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex after ulnar-shortening osteotomy: second-look arthroscopy.,"PURPOSE: Ulnar shortening is a widely used procedure for various conditions associated with ulnar wrist pain, including triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury; however, few reports have examined the condition of the TFCC after osteotomy. The central avascular zone of the TFCC generally is considered to have no potential to heal. This study investigated whether the avascular zone of the TFCC has any potential for repair, and whether repair of the torn disc proper correlates with clinical findings.METHODS: Between 1987 and 2005, we performed 75 second-look arthroscopies after an ulnar-shortening osteotomy for ulnar wrist disorders. Of these, 32 wrists with a TFCC (disc proper) tear on first arthroscopy were included in this study. Data from patient charts, radiography, and video images of arthroscopy were reviewed retrospectively. Tears of the disc proper were classified as radial, central, or ulnar tears, and as either linear or round tears.RESULTS: Meticulous second-look arthroscopy showed repair of tears in 50% of studied wrists. Round tears tended to repair better than linear tears. Although the final clinical score was better in repaired wrists than in nonrepaired wrists, no marked differences were noted between groups in terms of age, gender, preoperative ulnar variance, follow-up period, or surgical procedures used.CONCLUSIONS: The avascular zone of the TFCC possesses some potential for repair; however, factors promoting spontaneous repair of this tissue were not identified.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,17398353,2007
[Arthroscopic treatment of the ulnar impaction syndrome].,"The ulnar impaction syndrome is due to hyperpressure in the ulnocarpal joint. It occurs most frequently following distal radial fractures with shortening, but can also be secondary to a primitive length discrepancy between a short radius and a long ulna (positive ulnar variance). Symptoms and clinical findings, even though characteristic, are not specific. Standard X rays show a positive ulnar variance, and sometimes a hyperpressure cyst in the lunate.

[Arthroscopic management of recent or chronic lesions of triangular fibrocartilage complex of the wrist].,"Lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex of the wrist (TFCC) have perfectly been dismembered by Andrew Palmer and have largely benefited from progress of arthroscopy of the wrist. One distinguishes thus traumatic lesions (class 1) individualized according to their localization, central (1-A), ulnar (1-B), radial (1-D) or distal (1-C). Central lesions are classically associated to a positive ulnar variance. The clinical symptomatology evokes a meniscal like syndrome of the wrist. In case of failure of the medical treatment, it will be necessary to propose a surgical procedure guided by histopathology of the triangular complex. Thus, ulnar peripheral richly vascularized lesions (1-B) could therefore potentially heal and will have to benefit by an attempt of surgical reattachment (arthroscopic technique of Whipple, Poehling or other techniques) or by an osteosynthesis in case of fracture on the basis on the ulnar styloid process. Central fibrocartilage lesions (1-A) or radial avulsions (1-D) are less vascularized and have therefore little probability to heal; they will benefit then ideally from the endoscopic debridement of unstable flaps of the central portion of TFCC. No immobilization is required and rehabilitation is immediately undertaken. Less frequent class 1-C lesions justify in our practice a simple arthroscopic regularization, alone complete ruptures could have necessitate a direct suture. Class 2 degenerative lesions are graduated (A to E) according to evolution of the chondromalacia of the ulnar head and carpal bone, perforation of the central disc and lunotriquetral ligament degeneration. They are usually associated with a constitutional or an acquired ulnar plus variance syndrome, for example after a distal radius fracture malunion. The clinical symptomatology needs to differentiate them from the simple frequent physiological perforations after the age of 50 years.

"Evaluation of the triangular fibrocartilage in cadaveric wrists by means of arthrography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and MR arthrography.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of arthrography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and MR arthrography in the detection and localization of defects of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) in cadaveric wrists, using arthroscopy as a reference standard.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four specimen wrists were evaluated. The different imaging modalities were blinded to reviewers and were interpreted independently. A classification of TFC defects was used for the evaluation of images in the different imaging modalities, thus permitting a more uniform correlation. Two cases were excluded from the MR imaging study because of poor image quality. Contingency tables with the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis.RESULTS: Defects of the TFC were identified in 17 of the 24 specimen wrists by means of arthroscopy, and 16 defects were observed when arthrography was carried out. With MR imaging 14 defects of the TFC were detected in the 22 specimen wrists evaluated, and with MR arthrography 16 defects were observed. Most defects were central or combined (two or more defects). In comparison to arthroscopy, the accepted diagnostic gold standard, the following results were found for arthrography in the detection of TFC defects: sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%, and accuracy 95% (P&lt;0.0005); for MR imaging: sensitivity 86%, specificity 85%, and accuracy 70% (P&lt;0.002); and for MR arthrography: sensitivity 100%, specificity 85%, and accuracy 95% (P&lt;0.0005).CONCLUSION: The results of the study seem to indicate that both arthrography and MR arthrography have high accuracy, and either would be useful for evaluation of the TFC. The combined approach using both techniques would have a very high accuracy equivalent to that resulting from arthroscopy.","Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)",17325933,2007
Ulnar nerve palsy associated with fracture of the distal radius.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features and outcome of a series of patients with complete motor and sensory ulnar nerve palsy associated with a fracture of the distal radius.DESIGN: Retrospective case series.SETTING: Level 1 trauma center.PARTICIPANTS: Five adults with acute complete motor and sensory ulnar nerve palsy associated with fracture of the distal radius were treated during a 2 year period. There were 3 men and 2 women, with an average age of 42 years (range, 33 to 56 years). All 5 distal radius fractures were high energy and widely displaced. Three patients had an associated ulna fracture (2 styloid, 1 styloid and distal diaphysis), and 1 had a complete triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) avulsion from the distal ulna (associated with an open wound). Two patients had open fractures.INTERVENTION: Open reduction and internal fixation of the distal radius fracture in 4 patients and external fixation in 1 patient. Three patients had exploration and release of the ulnar nerve because it was associated with an acute carpal tunnel syndrome.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Recovery of ulnar nerve function.RESULTS: At an average follow-up of 17 months, 4 patients had complete or near-complete recovery of ulnar nerve function. One patient had moderate motor and mild sensory dysfunction.CONCLUSIONS: Acute ulnar nerve palsy may occur in association with high-energy, widely displaced fractures of the distal radius. These are usually neurapraxic injuries that recover to normal or near-normal strength and sensation. We recommend exploration and release of a complete ulnar nerve palsy associated with a fracture of the distal radius fracture when there is an open wound or an acute carpal tunnel syndrome, and observation without exploration otherwise.",Journal of orthopaedic trauma,17304066,2007

Accuracy of direct magnetic resonance arthrography in the diagnosis of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears of the wrist.,"The aim of this study was to assess the value of direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography of the wrist for detecting full-thickness tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Twenty-four consecutive patients who had ulnar-sided wrist pain and clinical suspicion of TFCC tear were included in the study. All patients underwent direct MR arthrography and then wrist arthroscopy, and the results of MR arthrography were compared with the arthroscopic findings. The positive predictive value of MR arthrography in detecting TFCC full-thickness tear was 0.95, and the negative predictive value was 0.50. The sensitivity of MR arthrography in detecting a TFCC full-thickness tear was 74% (15/19), and specificity was 80% (4/5). The overall accuracy of MR arthrography in detecting a full-thickness tear of the TFCC in our study was 79% (19/24). We believe that diagnosis of tears in the TFCC by direct MR arthrography is not entirely satisfactory, although MR arthrography has a high positive predictive value for detecting TFCC tears. Negative results of MR arthrography in patients with clinical suspicion of TFCC tear should be interpreted with caution.",International orthopaedics,17216523,2007
Peripheral tear of the triangular fibrocartilage: depiction with MR arthrography of the distal radioulnar joint.,"OBJECTIVE: Although central tears of the triangular fibrocartilage are easily seen on imaging, peripheral tears of the ulnar attachment are frequently missed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of MR arthrography of the distal radioulnar joint in depiction of peripheral tears of the triangular fibrocartilage.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients (18 women, 23 men; mean age, 38 years; age range, 18-60 years) underwent MR arthrography and wrist arthroscopy. For MR arthrography, iopamidol (300 mg I/mL) and gadopentetate dimeglumine (4 mmol/L) were injected into the distal radioulnar joint. Consensus review of both MR arthrograms and conventional arthrograms was performed by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. Presence or absence of communicating and noncommunicating tears of the ulnar attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage was recorded. Arthroscopy was used as the standard of reference for determining sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detection of tears of the ulnar attachment.RESULTS: At MR arthrography, communicating tear of the ulnar attachment was diagnosed in three patients, noncommunicating tear in 19 patients, and normal attachment in 19 patients. Arthroscopy revealed peripheral tear of the triangular fibrocartilage in all three patients with communicating tear, in 14 of 19 patients with noncommunicating tear, and in three of 19 patients with normal attachment. The sensitivity was 85% (17/20), specificity was 76% (16/21), and accuracy was 80% (33/41).CONCLUSION: MR arthrography of the distal radioulnar joint is accurate in depiction of peripheral tears of the ulnar attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage.

Comparison between high-resolution MRI with a microscopy coil and arthroscopy in triangular fibrocartilage complex injury.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could detect injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).METHODS: Eleven patients who showed both a positive sign during the ulnocarpal stress test and tenderness at the distal end of the ulna had a high-resolution MRI using a 47-mm diameter microscopy coil. Six regions of the TFCC were investigated for injury: the radial attachment, disc, ulnar attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC), ulnotriquetral ligament, palmar radioulnar ligament (PRUL), and dorsal radioulnar ligament (DRUL). Arthroscopy was performed subsequently on each patient.RESULTS: For injuries to the radial attachment or the disc of the TFC, a high-resolution MRI showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared with arthroscopy. In 3 cases in which injury to the ulnar attachment of the TFC was detected with MRI and examination showed a positive piano-key sign and distal radioulnar joint instability, only 1 injury was confirmed with arthrotomy. For MRI diagnosis of an ulnotriquetral ulnolunate attachment injury, the sensitivity was 100% and the specificity was 70%; however, 3 cases had false-positive results. Finally MRI had 100% sensitivity for detecting DRUL and PRUL injuries, although specificities were 75% and 83%, respectively. With MRI there were 2 false-positive DRUL injury diagnoses and 1 false-positive PRUL injury diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution MRI using a microscopy surface coil allowed assessment of each TFCC component and showed a higher accuracy for diagnosing injuries to the radial attachment and the disc of the TFC compared with previous studies. High-resolution MRI, however, was not able to diagnose DRUL, PRUL, or ulnolunate ligament injuries accurately.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic III.",The Journal of hand surgery,17027792,2006

Role of MR imaging in chronic wrist pain.,"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for chronic wrist pain is challenging. Correct assessment of the triangular fibrocartilage, hyaline cartilage, ligaments, and tendons has become mandatory for comprehensive decision making in wrist surgery. The MR technique, potential and limits of MR imaging in patients with chronic wrist pain will be discussed. MR arthrography with injection of gadolinium-containing contrast material into the distal radioulnar joint is suggested for evaluation of the triangular fibrocartilage. The clinically meaningful ulnar-sided peripheral tears are otherwise hard to diagnose. The diagnostic performance of MR imaging for interosseous ligament tears varies considerably. The sensitivity for scapholunate ligament tears is consistently better than for lunotriquetral ligament tears. Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging is considered to be the best technique for detecting established avascularity of bone, but the assessment of the MR results remains challenging. Most cases of ulnar impaction syndrome have characteristic focal signal intensity changes in the ulnar aspect of the lunate. Avascular necrosis of the lunate (Kienböck's disease) is characterized by signal changes starting in the proximal radial aspect of the lunate. MR imaging is extremely sensitive for occult fractures. Questions arise if occult posttraumatic bone lesions seen on MR images only necessarily require the same treatment as fractures evident on plain films or computed tomography (CT) images. MR imaging and ultrasound are equally effective for detecting occult carpal ganglia. Carpe bossu (carpal boss) is a bony protuberance of a carpometacarpal joint II and III which may be associated with pain.",European radiology,16932876,2006

Arthrographic and CT arthrographic findings in dorsal peripheral detachment of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex.,"Arthrography and CT arthrogram were evaluated in the diagnosis of dorsal peripheral detachment of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) in the wrist. The imaging findings and medical records of 19 patients, who underwent surgical repair of a dorsal peripheral detachment of the TFCC, were retrospectively studied. Diagnoses were based on the results of the arthrography and CT arthrogram as well as on the clinical examination. The arthrographic features assessed included abnormal filling of the tendon sheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) and irregular contrast extravasate in the dorsal ulnar and peristyloid region. The findings on arthrography and CT arthrography were correlated with the arthroscopic results.

Functional results post-triangular fibrocartilage complex reconstruction with extensor carpi ulnaris with or without ulnar shortening in chronic distal radioulnar joint instability.,"From September 1996 to September 2001, 37 adult patients were diagnosed with chronic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears with distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability in our clinic. They had all received the procedure of TFCC reconstruction with partial extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) combined with or without ulnar shortening. There were 36 males and one female in the study with a mean age of 22.4 years. The follow-up period ranged from 25 to 48 months with a mean of 36.2 months. All patients received the rehabilitation programme and were re-examined at our outpatient department. The results were graded according to the Mayo Modified Wrist Score. Eleven of the 37 patients rated their wrists &quot;excellent&quot;, 22 rated &quot;good&quot;, and four rated &quot;fair&quot;.

Therefore, TFCC reconstruction with partial ECU tendon combined with or without ulnar shortening procedure is an effective method for post-traumatic chronic TFCC tears with DRUJ instability suggested by this study.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,16568510,2006
Condylar Stabilizing Technique with AO/ASIF Distal Radius Plate for Colles' Fracture Associated with Osteoporosis.,"The author established a new reduction and fixation technique for osteoporotic distal radius fracture with a use of AO/ASIF volar distal radius plate, referring to the condylar plating technique in distal femoral fracture. This technique is performed in three steps. First, distal fixation is through the insertion of buttress pins just beneath the subchondral bone with a convergent angle of 10 degrees to the articular surface under fluoroscopic assistance. Second, the proximal limb of the plate is lined up with the radius shaft so that the fracture is reduced automatically and anatomically. Third, by rotating the proximal limb of the plate ulnarly and lifting up the ulnar border of the articular surface, the fracture is fixed less than the contralateral ulnar variance, to apply an adequate tension on the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). This method represents a valuable treatment modality for the most frequent types of unstable distal radius in elderly women.",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,16520603,2006
Relative contributions of the ulnar attachments of the triangular fibrocartilage complex to the dynamic stability of the distal radioulnar joint.,"PURPOSE: Laboratory studies evaluating the importance of the stabilizing structures of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) largely have been limited to static design. Clinically, dynamic loading seems to be an important component of DRUJ instability. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of dynamic loading on the stability of the DRUJ with foveal versus styloid triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) disruptions in a laboratory setting.METHODS: Twelve fresh-frozen cadaveric upper-extremity specimens were tested using a dynamic simulator to study the contributions of the 2 ulnar insertions of the TFCC to the dynamic stability of the DRUJ. The specimens were tested in 3 loading conditions (no load, agonist loading, antagonist loading) in 3 different states of the TFCC (intact, foveal disruption, styloid disruption).RESULTS: Without load no significant differences were found for the different conditions of the TFCC. Under loaded conditions the foveal insertion had a greater effect on stability than did the styloid insertion. Under agonist loading significant differences were found during supinating and pronating motions. With antagonist loading a significant difference was found only during supination.CONCLUSIONS: The study results support the clinical impression that dynamic loading is an important component of DRUJ instability and that disruption of the foveal TFCC insertion into the foveal region of the distal ulna can produce instability.",The Journal of hand surgery,16516740,2006
Pediatric distal radius fractures and triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries.,"Management of distal radius fractures is guided by the pattern and location of injury, degree of deformity, and expectations of bony remodeling based on the amount of remaining skeletal growth.Indications for surgical treatment include unstable or irreducible fractures, open fractures, floating elbow injuries, and neurovascular or soft-tissue compromise precluding cast immobilization. Patients and families should be counseled regarding the potential for post-traumatic distal radial growth arrest following physeal fractures. In these cases, epiphysiodeses, ulnar shortening osteotomies, or corrective radial osteotomies may be performed, depending on the pattern of arrest,degree of deformity, and remaining skeletal growth.TFCC tears may be the source of ulnar-sided wrist pain in children and adolescents, though symptoms and physical examination findings maybe subtle. Patients who have persistent pain and functional limitations despite activity modification and therapy are candidates for surgical treatment. Appropriate repair of peripheral TFCC tears with correction of concomitant wrist pathology restores normal wrist anatomy, alleviates pain, and allows for return to functional activities.",Hand clinics,16504777,2006
Dorsal capsulodesis for scapholunate instability--effect on patient disability and wrist pain.,"Twenty cases of scapho-lunate instability have been reviewed, to determine the effect of dorsal capsulodesis on disability and wrist pain. The average follow-up was 41 (range 13-63) months. There was a significant improvement in the pre-operative Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation score from 108 (range 18-150) to a postoperative score of 60 (range 0-132). All wrist movements and grip strength were reduced postoperatively but only the reductions in flexion and radial deviation were statistically significant. Seventeen (85%) patients were satisfied with the operation. One patient remained unemployed after surgery. Five patients returned to their normal jobs. This study shows that dorsal capsulodesis should remain an important option in the treatment of scapholunate instability.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",16476513,2006
An overview of MR arthrography with emphasis on the current technique and applicational hints and tips.,"Magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography has been investigated in every major peripheral joint of the body, and has been proven to be effective in determining the integrity of intraarticular ligamentous and fibrocartilaginous structures and in the detection or assessment of osteochondral lesions and loose bodies in selected cases. Several methods could be used to create arthrogram effect during MR imaging, however, direct MR arthrography using diluted gadolinium as the contrast agent is the most commonly used technique and is the most reliable of all. MR arthrography is useful for demonstrating labrocapsular-ligamentous abnormalities and distinguishing partial thickness rotator cuff tears from focal full thickness tears in the shoulder, identifying or excluding recurrent tears following meniscal operations in the knee, demonstrating perforations of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and ligaments in the wrist, showing labral tears in the hip, diagnosing ligament tears in the ankle and identifying osteochondral lesions or loose bodies in any of the aforementioned joints. In this article, an overview of techniques of MR arthrography is provided with emphasis on direct MR arthrography using diluted gadolinium as the contrast agent. The current applications of the technique in major peripheral joints are reviewed, with emphasis given to the shoulder joint where the role of this technique has become well established.",European journal of radiology,16464555,2006
Ulnar-positive variance as a predictor of distal radioulnar joint ligament disruption.,"PURPOSE: Previous cadaveric data show that disruption of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) at the wrist allows 0.5 to 3.0 mm of proximal radius migration. Anatomic studies have documented the presence of superficial and deep fibers of both the palmar and the dorsal distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) ligaments. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of the superficial and deep fibers of the DRUJ ligaments to longitudinal forearm stability as measured by ulnar-positive variance.METHODS: Eight fresh-frozen cadaver specimens were included in this study. Each specimen was secured with external fixation clamps to a sequential loading frame with the elbow in 90 degrees of flexion and the forearm and wrist in neutral pronation supination, neutral ulnar-radial deviation, and neutral volar-dorsal angulation. The radial head was resected and a force gauge was applied to the proximal radius. The peripheral TFCC was identified through an incision between the fifth and sixth extensor compartments and the dorsal capsulotomy of the DRUJ capsule. After baseline measurement sequential transection of the superficial and deep fibers of the TFCC was performed. Before and after each step load application and removal were performed by attaching an 88.90-N weight to the end of a force gauge and via longitudinal traction on the proximal part of the radius, and ulnar variance was measured with wrist fluoroscopy.RESULTS: Transection of the superficial TFCC fibers resulted in radius migration of 0.70 mm. This migration, however, was not significantly different from that observed at baseline. After both the superficial and deep TFCC fibers were transected the radius migrated proximately with load. This change of ulnar variance was significantly greater than that observed at baseline or after transection of only the superficial TFCC fibers.CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic injury to the TFCC with radiographic evidence of ulnar-positive variance may be an indication of disruption of the deep TFCC fibers.",The Journal of hand surgery,16344174,2005
Arthroscopic suture repair of peripheral tears of triangular fibrocartilage complex using a volar portal.,Surgical repair of a Palmer type IB triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear can be difficult using conventional dorsal portals and it may need special repair kits.

Distal radioulnar joint instability in distal radius fractures: the role of sigmoid notch and triangular fibrocartilage complex revisited.,"The stabilising effects of various structures of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) have been heavily debated. This biomechanical cadaveric study examined the effects of the volar and dorsal lips of the sigmoid notch and the volar and dorsal aspects of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) on DRUJ stability. Sequential fractures of the distal radius and sectioning of the TFCC were performed followed by measurements of ulnar translation with the forearm in pronation, neutral and supination. A dorsal lunate facet fracture created instability in pronation. Lunate facet fractures alone did not create instability in other forearm positions. Sectioning of the volar TFCC after loss of the dorsal TFCC by a dorsal lunate facet fracture caused DRUJ instability with the forearm in neutral position. Sectioning of the dorsal TFCC after loss of the volar TFCC due to a volar lunate facet fracture created instability in neutral and pronated positions.",Injury,16324702,2005
Hemiresection arthroplasty of the distal radioulnar joint.,"One of the critical requirements for this procedure to succeed is a functional TFCC structure. In rheumatoid arthritis or traumatic disruption of the DRUJ, the TFCC is unstable. If the TFCC can be reconstructed and DRUJ arthritis exists, this is the situation in which the hemiresection procedure excels. In the face of a normal DRUJ without arthritis, an ulnar shortening with a repair of the TFCC, if necessary, is the more appropriate procedure. The other caveat for this procedure to succeed is a careful preoperative plan to make sure stylocarpal impingement does not occur. The procedure does not restore stability in the unstable painful radioulnar joint; it simply substitutes a less painful instability. When correctly planned and performed the hemiresection interposition technique can be a good procedure in the arsenal of treatment for the DRUJ.",Hand clinics,16274869,2005
Ulnar impaction syndrome.,"Although Palmer's classification of TFCC lesions differentiates post-traumatic central perforations (IA tears) from degenerative tears secondary to ulnocarpal impaction (IIC) [3], the distinction is not always clear clinically. In the final analysis, the literature suggests that as many as 25% of wrists with TFCC tears have residual symptoms following arthroscopic debridement alone [23], and it is likely that static or dynamic ul-nar positive variance plays a role [2,5,17,25]. The authors' results suggest that combined arthroscopic TFCC debridement and wafer resection are feasible and efficacious as treatment for all stages of ulnar impaction syndrome. When class II A and B changes are observed, that is, when a TFCC perforation has not yet developed, the authors have observed favorable results in most patients following arthroscopic TFCC central disc excision and wafer resection as an alternative to ulnar shortening osteotomy [33] or open wafer excision [10].",Hand clinics,16274867,2005
Magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"In a retrospective survey we compared the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols with the arthroscopic findings for triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions. We found a sensitivity of 0.61 and specificity of 0.88 for MRI. The positive predictive value was 0.85 and the negative predictive value was only 0.68. These values are very similar to those in other recent surveys. These findings and the reviewed publications all indicate that MRI cannot replace arthroscopy. Special coils and MRI-arthrography can significantly enhance the specificity and the sensitivity. A negative MRI is not an endpoint and not a contraindication for further exploration, in particular for arthroscopy.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,16184992,2005
Arthroscopically assisted repair of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex tears: factors affecting outcome.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to identify factors affecting the outcome after arthroscopically assisted repair of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears.TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective case series.METHODS: Thirty-five patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of traumatic TFCC tears were enrolled in this study (mean age, 34 +/- 12 years; 22 female and 13 male patients; mean follow-up, 29 months; range, 6 to 82 months). Patients with TFCC tears associated with distal radius fractures, or significant wrist bone or neurovascular pathology were excluded from the study. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire score was used as the primary variable during statistical analysis to identify factors determining outcome.RESULTS: The DASH score in this study was 12 +/- 12 points. A significant correlation was found between the age of the patient and the DASH score, indicating that older age has a significant negative effect on functional outcome. Significant correlations were also found between the DASH score and (1) decreased percentage of grip strength compared with the healthy side, (2) decreased supination, and (3) positive postoperative ulnar variance.CONCLUSIONS: Age-related degenerative changes in the wrist might contribute to poor outcome and a TFCC tear resulting from minor or repetitive trauma. Loss of wrist rotation, grip strength, and ulnar positive variance are factors that are correlated with poor outcome.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,16171639,2005
Arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex debridement using radiofrequency probes.,"The initial results of using radiofrequency probes for debridement of a torn triangular fibrocartilage complex were studied in 20 patients with a mean age of 44 (range 27-56) years presenting with ulnar-sided wrist pain. On arthroscopic examination, 18 central and two radial triangular fibrocartilage complex tears were identified and debrided to a stable rim using radiofrequency probes. The mean follow-up was 22 (range 9-35) months. Seventeen patients experienced substantial pain relief. In three, the pain was unchanged. The mean flexion extension arc was 132 degrees , pronosupination arc 155 degrees and mean grip strength was 83% of that of the unaffected side. Using the modified Mayo wrist score, there were ten excellent, seven good and three fair results. No perioperative complications occurred. Radiofrequency probes were found to be safe and effective for use in triangular fibrocartilage complex debridement. These results compare favourably with other standard methods of treatment of this problem.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",16111792,2005
Reconstructive procedure for unstable radial-sided triangular fibrocartilage complex avulsions.,"PURPOSE: Radial-sided avulsions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) (Palmer 1D) with distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability remain a challenging pathology to treat. We tested an intra-articular reconstruction that addresses unstable radial-sided TFCC avulsions.METHODS: Ten preserved, dissected, cadaveric forearm specimens with intact TFCC and without ulnar-positive variance had biomechanical testing using a hydraulic testing device. The measurement of total displacement of the ulna relative to the radius was performed with an applied load ranging from 20 N in a volar direction to 20 N in a dorsal direction. Specimens were tested sequentially with intact TFCC, with surgically induced Palmer 1D lesions, and after reconstruction of the TFCC. All tests were performed at neutral, maximal pronation, and maximal supination.RESULTS: The mean total displacements of the DRUJ of the specimens at neutral rotation were as follows: 4.1 +/- 0.4 mm for the intact specimens compared with 11.8 +/- 0.8 mm after creation of the tear and 3.9 +/- 0.7 mm for the reconstructed specimens. In maximal pronation the mean total displacements were as follows: 2.4 +/- 0.3 mm intact versus 4.9 +/- 0.7 mm for torn and 2.1 +/- 0.3 mm after reconstruction. In maximal supination the mean total displacements were as follows: 1.4 +/- 0.2 mm intact versus 5.7 +/- 1.3 mm for torn and 1.0 +/- 0.1 mm after reconstruction. All specimens obtained the preoperative pronation and supination motion after the reconstruction.CONCLUSIONS: Current procedures are unable to restore DRUJ stability without a significant limitation of pronation and supination. This intra-articular reconstruction of radial-sided TFCC avulsions succeeded in restoring baseline stability to the DRUJ without interfering with pronation/supination.",The Journal of hand surgery,16039365,2005
Ulnar shortening effect on distal radioulnar joint stability: a biomechanical study.,"PURPOSE: The ulnar-shortening procedure has been adopted widely to reduce pressure between the ulna and ulnar carpus in ulnocarpal abutment syndrome. The hammock-like structure of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), which supports and connects the ulnocarpal and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), variably is torn in this condition. The degree to which the torn TFCC may be tensioned to restabilize the DRUJ with ulnar recession is uncertain. This study examined changes in the stabilizing effect of the ulnar-shortening procedure in several TFCC tear conditions.METHODS: Six fresh-frozen cadaver arms amputated at the midportion of the humerus were used. The skin, muscles, and capsuloligamentous structures below the elbow all were preserved. The ulna and humerus were affixed firmly to a custom mount that allowed 60 degrees of forearm rotation. An external fixator was attached to the distal ulna leaving space for a 10-mm resection of the ulna to allow progressive shortening. The radius was attached to a materials testing machine. The load-displacement curves were obtained while translating the distal radius dorsally or palmarly with respect to the ulna at 1.25 mm/s. Stiffness in dorsopalmar displacement was recorded at 1-mm intervals through 6 mm of length. These measurements then were compared with controls (0 mm shortening of the intact specimens) at 60 degrees pronation, neutral position, and 60 degrees supination. The tests then were repeated after sectioning either the dorsal or palmar portion of the radioulnar ligament (RUL) and then after complete sectioning of the RUL. Each portion was sectioned at its attachment to the ulnar fovea.RESULTS: The stiffness of the DRUJ increased significantly in all 3 rotatory positions after shortening the ulna. A shortening of 6 mm resulted in a 26% to 44% increase in DRUJ stiffness. The stiffness decreased after partial sectioning of the RUL but increased with further ulnar shortening in all 3 positions. The DRUJ stiffness with the partially sectioned RUL after a shortening of 3 to 6 mm was as large as that of the intact specimens. The stiffness of the DRUJ after the complete section of the RUL was significantly smaller than that of the intact specimens even after shortening of 6 mm.CONCLUSIONS: The ulnar-shortening procedure can stabilize the DRUJ by increasing intrastructural tension of the TFCC, only when the RUL is attached totally or partially to the ulnar fovea. If the RUL is avulsed completely then stability of the DRUJ no longer is obtained by the ulnar-shortening procedure.",The Journal of hand surgery,16039364,2005
Disability and function after arthroscopic repair of ulnar avulsions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex of the wrist.,"Ulnar wrist pain due to a lesion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is frequent. Based on studies of the vascularity, (traumatic) ulnar avulsions can be sutured. Arthroscopic techniques have been designed but results are scarcely published. This is a follow-up study of 52 patients with an ulnar avulsion of the TFCC. All patients were treated with an arthroscopic technique. Evaluation was directed to the subjective outcome, functionality ( using the DASH score) and objective parameters. The mean DASH score was 17.3. Pain was absent or minimal in 47 patients. The grip force was 80% of the contralateral side. Based on these findings, arthroscopic repair of the TFCC appears to be a reliable technique.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,16035701,2005
Carpal ligament injuries with acute scaphoid fractures - a combined wrist injury.,"Fifty-two consecutive patients with acute scaphoid fractures were treated by closed reduction and percutaneous screw fixation. In addition, all underwent a wrist arthrogram and 22 patients also underwent a wrist arthroscopy. Eighteen patients (34%) had an associated carpal ligament injury (four scapholunate ligament, eight lunotriquetral ligament, two combined, three TFCC and one minor leak from the distal carpal row). These patients had worse Mayo wrist scores (no ligament injury median score=95: ligament injury median score=85) at a mean final follow-up of 61 weeks. We advocate that scaphoid fractures with associated carpal ligament injuries should be defined as a combined wrist injury.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",15935528,2005
Results of arthroscopic reduction and percutaneous fixation for acute displaced scaphoid fractures.,"PURPOSE: This study used percutaneous techniques augmented by simultaneous wrist arthroscopy to visualize the fracture and thus confirm the fracture alignment and reduction and also to assesses the concurrent associated ligament injuries.TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective study.METHODS: Arthroscopy was used to help to reduce scaphoid fractures and assess soft-tissue injuries in 15 acute cases (13 male and 2 female patients). The fractures were treated by reduction under arthroscopic control and percutaneous fixation with the cannulated interosseous compression screw. Soft-tissue lesions were also treated at the same time using debridement, suture repair, or K-wire transfixation. The average age of the patients was 29.2 years (range, 19 to 48 years).RESULTS: Two patients (13.3%) had scapholunate (SL) ligament injuries, and both exhibited partial tear of the SL ligament. Four patients (26.7%) suffered lunotriquetral (LT) ligament injuries and received ligament debridement, K-wire fixation of the LT joint, and splinting. Six patients (40%) had chondral fractures. Additionally, the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was torn in 5 patients (33%). Finally, 5 patients (33%) suffered radioscaphocapitate ligament or long radiolunate ligament injuries. All fractures healed without malunion or nonunion and, at follow-up of 24 to 28 months, 11 patients had excellent results and 4 had good results based on Mayo Modified Wrist Scores.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that arthroscopic reduction may be considered for scaphoid fractures because this approach can use a single procedure to achieve acceptable restoration of fractures as well as assessment and management of soft-tissue lesions.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV Therapeutic Study, case series with no, or historical, control group.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,15891731,2005
[Wrist lesions in MRI arthrography compared with wrist arthroscopy].,"BACKGROUND: Wrist arthroscopy is routinely used for diagnosis of ligamentous lesions to the wrist. Although it is very sensitive and specific, it is also more invasive than other available diagnostic techniques.METHOD: In a prospective trial, 125 patients (80 men, 45 women) 37 years old (+/- 12) with clinical evidence of wrist lesions were evaluated with direct wrist arthro MRI. Within 24 hours following direct arthro MRI wrist arthroscopy was performed. The surgeons and radiologists were not aware of the other results until completion of their investigation. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were determined.RESULTS: According to the MRI findings, lesions of the TFCC were suggested in 70 patients (56 % of all patients). In 65 cases this was confirmed by wrist arthroscopy. In the remaining 55 patients no TFCC lesions were detected by MRI. However in three cases TFCC lesions were found by arthroscopy. In the remaining 52 patients MRI accurately excluded TFCC lesions. There was a correlation of MRI and arthroscopy in detecting TFCC lesions in 93.6 %. Sensitivity was 94 %, specificity 89 %, positive predictive value 91 % and negative predictive value 93 %. Complete scapholunate ligament tears were detected by MRI in 12 (9.6 %) cases. Correlation with wrist arthroscopy was 99 %, sensitivity 92 %, specificity 100 %, positive and negative predictive value 100 % and 99 %, respectively. Accuracy for incomplete scapholunate lesions (n = 17, 13.6 %) and lunotriquetral tears (n = 4, 3.2 %) was poor (sensitivity 59 % and 25 %, specificity 100 % and 99 %).CONCLUSION: Though sensitivity of MRI arthrography approaches that of arthroscopy, it cannot replace it at the moment. However, it is a potent additional tool for wrist diagnosis if intraarticular contrast is used. It can facilitate diagnosis and indications for surgery of the wrist. It may make arthroscopic and more invasive interventions for diagnostic purposes avoidable in future.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",15877268,2005
[Intracarpal ligament injuries associated with wrist fractures: a prospective radioclinical study of 40 patients].,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: We performed a prospective study to search for arthrographic signs in favor of intracarpal ligament lesions occurring concomitantly with wrist fractures. We looked for a relationship between type of fracture and displacement and examined their impact on early functional outcome.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The series included 40 patients treated over a 1-year period. All 40 patients had a displaced wrist fracture requiring surgical treatment. A three-phase arthrography was performed during the initial operation in order to search for injuries involving the scapho-lunate, luno-pyramidal or triangular complex ligaments. A second arthrography was performed at the time the osteosynthesis material was removed. All patients were followed one year postperatively. Functional outcome was recorded at one year.RESULTS: Abnormal images were found in 57% of the patients at the first arthrography. Injury to the triangular complex predominated, followed by combined injuries. There was no statistical correlation between type of fracture, degree of displacement, and presence of ligament lesions (p &gt; 0.05). Lesions of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) were significantly increased (p = 0.04) in the event of intra-articular fracture. Age and gender did not influence ligament injury. At one year, the functional outcome was statistically comparable between patients with and without ligament injury. At the second arthrography, we observed only five cases where cure of the luno-pyramidal ligament had been achieved.DISCUSSION: Intracarpal ligament injuries associated with wrist fractures are frequent. Age had no effect on occurrence of ligament injury in our series, similar to findings reported by others. Likewise, the type of fracture had no effect. Data in the literature show that intra-articular fractures and highly-displaced fractures aggravate ligament injury. Our functional results at one year did not demonstrate any significant difference in patients with and without ligament injury. A 3 or 5-year follow-up might provide further insight. Nevertheless, neglected scapho-lunate lesions still have a bad reputation in the literature, leading us to search for such lesions and to provide adapted treatment in all patients aged less than 50 years presenting a displaced fracture of the wrist.",Revue de chirurgie orthopedique et reparatrice de l'appareil moteur,15672920,2005
[Wrist arthroscopy. Current indications and results].,"Arthroscopy of the wrist is a recent technique but already validated for many indications. It rarely gives rise to complications but requires a learning curve just like any other endoscopic procedure. It allows complete visualization of the osseous, articular, synovial and ligamentous structures of the different joints comprising the wrist. There are two main indications for wrist arthroscopy: i) Diagnostic; when other investigations have proved inconclusive (assessment of carpal instabilities, osteochondral fractures and certain synovial pathologies...); ii) therapeutic; these have recently widened in terms of carpal pathology. Lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (traumatic or degenerative) are best diagnosed and treated arthroscopically. Arthroscopic treatment is the least invasive, most effective and safest means of performing procedures such as debridement, TFCC reattachment, and ulna shortening. Other conditions can benefit greatly from wrist arthroscopy such as certain wrist ganglions, rheumatoid synovitis, radiocarpal fractures and some scaphoid fractures. Degenerative pathology of the wrist also presents opportunities for articular debridement (&quot;shaving&quot;), synovectomy or even various &quot;ectomies&quot;.",Chirurgie de la main,15651241,2005
Preliminary experience of fully arthroscopic repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions.,"Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions are commonly repaired arthroscopically. Most of the interest in repairing TFCC lesions is focused on the development of an internal technique to avoid an extra incision of the skin. The most common techniques in use today are the inside-out or the outside-in, both of which have the disadvantage of requiring an additional opening to tie the suture. We suggest a personal method that allows an all-inside repair for type 1B lesions with a technique similar to the one used for rotator cuff repair in the shoulder.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,15346129,2004
Arthroscopic surgery for traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex injury.,"Clinical characteristics, diagnostic imaging, arthroscopic findings, and surgical results of arthroscopic treatment are reported in 62 hands with traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury treated between 1995 and 2002. This retrospective study also describes and compares the results of a novel arthroscopic suture technique for repairing tears with Palmer's class 1B and 1D tears. According to Palmer's classification, there were 10 class 1A, 27 1B, 8 1C, and 17 1D injuries. The arthroscopic suture and débridement treatments were done under brachial plexus block as a 1-day in-hospital procedure. Class 1D tears required transradial fixation to anchor the TFCC. Surgical results of suture groups according to Minami's criteria were excellent in 16 hands, good in 15 hands, fair in 1 hand, and poor in 1 hand. The results of the débridement group were excellent in 16 hands, good in 10 hands, fair in 2 hands, and poor in 1 hand. The results of the current study indicate that the novel suture technique were easy to perform, provided strong, tight repair for class 1D injuries, and was applicable for class 1B injuries in this small case series.",Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association,15278772,2004

[Arthroscopy in the diagnosis and therapy of wrist disorders].,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Arthroscopy of the wrist is a method facilitating the establishment of diagnosis in patients with wrist complaints which may also serve for surgical management of some of the causes of wrist pathology. The author presents his first experience with carpal arthroscopy as a diagnostic method as well as a therapeutic technique performed in one or two stages.MATERIAL: A total of 34 patients, 12 women and 22 men, in the age range of 14 to 64 years, underwent carpal arthroscopy. This was performed to treat acute or chronic conditions in 16 and 18 patients, respectively.METHODS: Arthroscopy was carried out with the hand in vertical traction, using distraction forces of 50 to 70 N, from the approach between the third and fourth or/and the fourth and fifth extensor compartments, in order to inspect the mediocarpal joint by an arthroscope with a diameter of 2.4 mm. Neither a tourniquet nor a pump was employed. When a lesion was detected, it was treated by arthroscopy or an open procedure in one surgical procedure. When indicated, further surgical intervention followed.RESULTS: The arthroscopic inspection revealed triangular fibrocartilagenous complex (TFCC) lesions in 18 patients. Injury to the scaphoid-lunate (SL) ligament was found in 16 patients. One patient had a combined lesion of the triquetral-lunate and SL ligaments, two showed a SL lesion together with a distal radius fracture, three were diagnosed with pseudoarthrosis of the scaphoid bone and one with synovitis after rheumatoid arthritis. In two patients, adhesions in the radiocarpal joint following a fracture of the distal radius were found and shaved. A total of 22 patients were treated by arthroscopic surgery; 19 underwent open procedures in one stage and five were indicated for secondary surgery.DISCUSSION: Wrist arthroscopy has been reported in the literature as the only method that can reveal damage to SL ligaments not shown by X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging examination. During arthroscopy, several interventions can directly be carried out by this procedure, such as treatment of the TFCC, and thus relieve the patient's complaints. Arthroscopy is irreplaceable in the diagnosis of dynamic carpal instability or injury to TFCC in ulnar-carpal impingement. Our experience suggests that arthroscopically-guided osteosynthesis of the distal radius has great prospects.CONCLUSIONS: In our hospital acute arthroscopy is indicated when carpal connective tissue lesions, potentially leading to wrist instability, are suspected, when damage to carpal ligaments is found by X-ray examination or when an acute TFCC lesion is suspected. Arthroscopically-guided osteosynthesis of the distal radius appears to be a prospective method. In patients with chronic complaints, wrist arthroscopy is indicated in suspected TFCC lesions with ulnar-carpal impingement, in chronic carpal synovitis, and before sperious operations on the carpal bones in order to ascertain the state of cartilage and plan the appropriate surgery.",Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca,15151098,2004
"[Lesions of the wrist disc. Pathology, diagnosis and treatment].","Lesions of the TFCC are currently a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Disc-injuries are often not identified and, therefore, acute ruptures are unfortunately not always immediately repaired. Moreover, therapeutic measures are still sparse and informative trial results are lacking.

[The anatomy of the ulnocarpal complex].,"The ulnocarpal complex (triangular fibrocartilage complex; TFCC) represents an intricate system of structures which secures motion guidance, stability and pressure transmission in the ulnocarpal compartment of the wrist joint. Anatomically, this complex consists of the ulnocarpal disc (triangular disc), palmar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments, ulnolunate, ulnotriquetral and ulnocapitate ligaments, ulnocarpal meniscus homologue, ulnar recess (prestyloid recess), ulnocarpal collateral ligament and tendon sheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris. The distal radioulnar joint and the interosseous membrane of the forearm, which lie close together, also belong functionally to the ulnocarpal complex. Together with the proximal radioulnar joint, they permit rotational movements of the hand (pronation and supination). This review highlights all components of the ulnocarpal complex systematically. Distinctive characteristics involving size, as well as variations, are listed, and their functional meaning analyzed. The accumulated knowledge serves as a basis for possible interventions both at the ulnocarpal complex and the distal radioulnar joint.",Der Orthopade,15127199,2004
3.0 T high-resolution MR imaging of carpal ligaments and TFCC.,"PURPOSE: To determine the diagnostic value of 3.0 Tesla MRI for imaging carpal ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Image quality of different optimized MRI sequences is evaluated for high resolution wrist anatomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were examined at 3.0 T and 1.5 T using following sequences: T1 SE, fat-saturated PD-/T2-TSE, TIRM, 3D T1/T2* DESS, 3D-CISS, 2D and 3D T2* MEDIC. Voxel size varied from 0.2 x 0.2 x 1.5 mm (2D sequences) to 0.33 mm (3) and 0.26 mm (3) (3D sequences). Image quality (signal-to-noise-ratio, contrast-to-noise-ratio, artifacts) and carpal ligament/TFCC detection rate were judged by a score. The results obtained from the 3.0 T and 1.5 T devices were compared.RESULTS: With identical voxel size, image matrix and FOV, 3.0 T MRI provided significantly better image quality and ligament detection rates for all sequences in comparison with 1.5 T. The 2D and 3D MEDIC sequences yielded best image quality and detection rates. Excellent image quality and visualization of ligament structures by the fat-suppressed PD-TSE sequence were compromised by a relatively high susceptibility to pulsation and motion artifacts. T1 SE and 3D DESS sequences gave moderate image quality and allowed only partial differentiation between ligament structures. TIRM, T2-TSE and 3D-CISS sequence proved to be unsuitable for examining ligaments at 3.0 T due to their poor image quality and detection rate.CONCLUSION: 3.0 T MRI of the wrist proved to be superior to 1.5 T MRI for high-resolution imaging of carpal ligaments and TFCC using 2D and 3D T2* MEDIC sequences. Clinical studies investigating ligament injuries or carpal instability are recommended for evaluating clinical relevance of high-resolution MRI of the wrist.",RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,15122464,2004
"[The arthroscopic &quot;wafer procedure&quot; in degenerative disc ulnocarpal tears with ulnocarpal compression syndrome. Techniques, indications, results].","The wafer procedure is a technique involving the partial resection of the distal ulna for the treatment of patients with symptomatic tears of the TFCC, for ulnar abutment syndrome or both. The TFCC-tears are classified as Palmer type 2. The wafer procedure can be performed as an open procedure or arthroscopically. It is an alternative to a shortening osteotomy of the ulna and decompresses the ulnocarpal joint. In ten cases with long-term follow-up, the preferability of the arthroscopic method is demonstrated: a minimally invasive technique, optimal assessment of all lesions, maximum protection of all uninjured structures in comparison to the open method, single stage procedure, and low complication rate. The long-term results are predominantly positive, so that the arthroscopic wafer procedure should be performed more often than it is today.",Der Orthopade,15112036,2004
"[The caput-ulnae-syndrome. Pathogenesis, clinic and therapy].","The ulnar head has a central function in stabilizing the wrist. In the treatment of caput ulnae syndrome, the radiocarpal joint must, therefore, always be considered. The integrity of the ulnar head and TFCC are of major importance for the rheumatoid wrist. Therefore, surgical treatment should be carried out early, and is indicated for drug-resistant synovitis and monarthritis of the wrist. Early synovectomy of the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) can be done as an open procedure or, when extensor tendon synovitis is absent, as an arthroscopic procedure. In most cases, however, treatment of manifest caput ulnae syndrome, sometimes even with rupture of the extensor tendons, is necessary. In these cases, resection of the ulnar head together with a dorsal wrist stabilization is indicated. Less often, arthrodesis of the DRUJ with segmental resection of the ulna or an arthroplasty are indicated. When choosing the procedure, the type and stage of wrist changes have to be considered. The DRUJ usually has to be treated together with the radiocarpal joint. Its isolated treatment is rarely indicated.",Der Orthopade,15105987,2004
A comparison of combined arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex debridement and arthroscopic wafer distal ulna resection versus arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex debridement and ulnar shortening osteotomy for ulnocarpal abutment syndrome.,"PURPOSE: Treatment of ulnocarpal abutment (UAS) syndrome involves decompression of the pressure and impingement, or abutment of the ulnocarpal articulation. Debridement of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears alone in the patient with UAS may have a failure rate of as much as 25% to 30%. Ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO) can be an effective treatment of failed TFCC debridement. Good results have been reported with combined arthroscopic TFCC debridement and mechanical arthroscopic distal ulnar resection. Similar results have been reported with both ulnar shortening osteotomy and open wafer distal ulnar resections in the UAS patient. Because all of these treatment choices appear to yield similar relief of symptoms, determination of the optimal treatment protocol remains a point of debate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 2 different surgical treatments for UAS.TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective review.METHODS: Eleven combined arthroscopic TFCC debridement and arthroscopic distal ulna resections (arthroscopic wafer procedures; AWP) were compared with 16 arthroscopic TFCC debridement and USOs. All patients had diagnostic wrist arthroscopy and arthroscopic TFCC debridement. All patients presented with ulnar wrist pain or neutral or positive ulnar variance, and all experienced at least 3 months of failed conservative management.RESULTS: At mean follow-up times of 21 and 15 months, respectively, 9 of 11 patients showed good to excellent results after arthroscopic TFCC debridement and AWP compared with 11 of 16 after arthroscopic TFCC debridement and USO. A statistically significant difference (P &lt;.05) in the complication rates was identified, including secondary procedures and tendonitis. One secondary procedure and 2 cases of tendonitis were seen in the arthroscopic wafer group.CONCLUSIONS: Combined arthroscopic TFCC debridement and arthroscopic wafer procedure provides similar pain relief and restoration of function with fewer secondary procedures and tendonitis when compared with arthroscopic TFCC debridement and USO, for the treatment of UAS.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,15067279,2004
An anatomical study of the ligaments of the ulnar compartment of the wrist.,"The ligamentous structures of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and their attachments were examined anatomically and histologically using fresh and embalmed cadavers. The TFCC was observed to have a three-dimensional structure consisting of three palmar ligaments--the short radiolunate (SRL), ulnolunate (UL), and ulnotriquetral (UT) ligaments. In addition, the attachment site of the ulnocarpal ligament (UC), which had been previously unknown, was identified. The dorsal components of the TFCC have been previously reported to consist solely of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) subsheath; however, the ligamentous components running from the ulnar styloid process to the triquetrum were found at a layer deeper than the floor of the ECU subsheath. The UC has been reported previously as a two-dimensional structure, but there has been some disagreement as to its attachment sites.(2-6,14,15) It is suggested that the dorsal UT ligament should be considered as a separate ligament, based on its different direction and distal attachment site as compared with those of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) and ECU subsheath.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,15002101,2004
[Direct MR arthrography of the wrist- value in detecting complete and partial defects of intrinsic ligaments and the TFCC in comparison with arthroscopy].,"PURPOSE: To assess the value of two-compartment magnetic resonance (MR) wrist arthrography in comparison with diagnostic arthroscopy for the evaluation of defects of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and intrinsic ligaments in patients with refractory wrist pain. The direct MR arthrographies were evaluated following arthroscopic classification with consideration of complete and partial defects. The distinction between these types of lesions has clinical implications for treatment procedures such as cast immobilization, arthroscopic debridement, surgical repair or partial intercarpal arthrodesis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients (25 female, 50 males, mean age 38.3 years) who suffered from refractory wrist pain without radiography evidence of carpal instability underwent two-compartment wrist MR arthrography. Under aseptic conditions a solution of gadopentate dimeglumine and iodinated contrast agent (concentration 2.5 mmol/l) was injected into the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints under fluoroscopy guidance. Using a scanner of 1.5 T field strength and a wrist-coil following sequences were acquired: coronary and sagittal T (1)-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequences (TR 500 ms, TE 25 ms, matrix 512 x 512.3 mm) and coronary fast low angle shot (FLASH) 3D sequences (TR 24 ms, TE 11 ms, matrix 256 x 256, 1.5 mm, flip angle 50 degrees). All patients underwent subsequent arthroscopy of the wrist. The direct MR arthrographies were evaluated retrospectively by two observers experienced in the diagnosis of wrist pathology. They were not aware of the clinicial, arthrographic and arthroscopic findings. Pathology of the scapholunate ligament was classified according to the guidelines of the German Society of Hand Surgery (DGH), lesions of the lunotriquetral ligament according to Hempfling and lesions of the TFCC according to Palmer.RESULTS: Twenty-five complete and 47 partial defects were detected arthroscopically (TFCC: 21/20, scapholunate ligament: 3/18, lunotriquetral ligament: 1/9). The TFCC showed a higher prevalence for degenerative lesions (11 type 2C-lesions and 20 type 2A/B lesions) than for traumatic lesions (5 type 1A lesions, 5 type 1D lesions). For direct MR arthrography, the obtained sensitivities and specificities in assessing complete defects were 96 % and 99.6 % (T (1)-weighted SE) and 92 % and 100 % (FLASH 3D), respectively. For all partial defects, sensitivities and specificities were 68.1 % and 93.3 % (T (1)-weighted SE) and 63 % and 96.1 % (FLASH 3D), respectively. For depicting partial defects of the scapholunate ligament the T (1)-weighted SE sequence (83.3/95.5 %) was superior to the FLASH 3D sequence (64.7/96.6 %), p &lt; 0.05. For the evaluation of the TFCC (T (1)-weighted SE: 65/94.4 %, FLASH 3D: 70/94.6 %) and the lunotriquetral ligament (T (1)-weighted SE: 44/89.4 %, FLASH 3D: 44 /96.7 %), direct MR arthrography showed an insufficient correlation with arthroscopy.CONCLUSION: Direct MR arthrography proved to be of equal value compared with diagnostic arthroscopy in detecting complete defects of the intrinsic ligaments and the TFCC. The method has the potential of replacing diagnostic arthroscopy for the evaluation of the intrinsic ligaments and the TFCC. The T (1)-weighted SE sequence appeared to be superior to the FLASH 3D sequence in evaluating partial defects of the scapholunate ligament. Direct MR arthrography did not reliably detect partial defects of the TFCC and the lunotriquetral ligament.",RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,14610703,2003
Virtual MR arthroscopy of the wrist joint: a new intraarticular perspective.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate whether virtual MR arthroscopy could be used to visualize the internal architecture of the radiocarpal compartment of the wrist joint in comparison to surgical arthroscopy.DESIGN: Diluted paramagnetic contrast material was injected into the radiocarpal compartment prior to MR examination in all patients. A fat-suppressed T1-weighted three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient echo sequence was acquired in addition to our standard MR imaging protocol in each patient. Three-dimensional data sets were then transferred to an independent workstation and were postprocessed using navigator software to generate surface rendered virtual MR arthroscopic images.PATIENTS: Nineteen patients referred for chronic ulnar-sided wrist pain were evaluated with conventional MR arthrography prospectively.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Virtual MR arthroscopic images demonstrating the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in an intraarticular perspective were achieved in 12 out of 19 patients. Our preliminary investigation suggests that although it has several limitations, virtual MR arthroscopy shows promise in visualizing the TFCC from an intraarticular perspective.",Skeletal radiology,14605770,2003
Suture anchor repair of ulnar-sided triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"Traditional open repair of traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears requires a relatively extensive exposure, and arthroscopic repair, though conceptually simple, can be technically demanding. We describe a mini-open suture anchor technique that, while minimally invasive, is easier to perform than previously described open or arthroscopic techniques. Results achieved using this technique in eight cases compare favourably with those reported for other techniques.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",14599826,2003
[Dynamic palmar instability of the ulnar head].,"Despite obvious clinical symptoms, dynamic, palmar instability of the ulnar head remains a diagnostic and therapeutic problem. This is demonstrated by a case of chronic, palmar instability of the ulnar head after a tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). A concomitant, minimal dorsal angulation of the radius after a fracture in childhood and a general capsulo-ligamentous laxity possibly were predisposing factors. Aspects of diagnostic and therapeutic options are discussed. In our case, due to secondary arthrosis, an arthrodesis of the distal radioulnar joint combined with a stabilization of the TFCC was opted for. Although the patient is painfree and mobile, she complains of a loss of power in supination. This salvage procedure probably could have been avoided by an earlier diagnosis.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",12964096,2003
High-resolution MR imaging of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC): comparison of microscopy coils and a conventional small surface coil.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare MR images of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) using microscopy coils with those using a conventional surface coil qualitatively and quantitatively.DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Proton density-weighted images and T2*-weighted images of the TFCC from ten normal volunteers were obtained with a conventional surface coil (C4 coil; 80 mm in diameter), a 47-mm microscopy surface coil and a 23-mm microscopy surface coil) at 1.5 T. Qualitative image analysis of MR images with three coils was performed by two radiologists who assigned one of five numerical scores (0, nonvisualization; 1, poor; 2, average; 3, good; 4, excellent) for five TFCC components, which were disc proper, triangular ligament, meniscus homologue, ulnotriquetral and ulnolunate ligament. Quantitative analysis included the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the disc proper of TFCC, the lunate cartilage, the lunate bone and the contrast-noise-ratio (C/N) between articular cartilage and disc proper or bone marrow were measured.RESULTS: All structures show higher scores qualitatively on MR with microscopy coils than those with a C4 coil, and the difference was significant with the exception of the ulnolunate ligament. MR with microscopy coils showed significantly higher S/N values than those with a conventional surface coil (P&lt;0.05 to P&lt;0.001). T2*-weighted images using microscopy coils showed significantly higher cartilage-disc proper C/N and cartilage-bone marrow C/N (P&lt;0.01 to P&lt;0.001). On proton density-weighted images, the C/N between cartilage and disc proper with two microscopy coils was significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) than that with a conventional coil.CONCLUSION: High-resolution MR images of the normal wrist using microscopy coils were superior to those using a conventional surface coil qualitatively and quantitatively. High-resolution MR imaging with a microscopy coil would be a promising method to diagnose TFCC lesions.",Skeletal radiology,12942205,2003
[Direct MR arthrography of the wrist in comparison with arthroscopy: a prospective study on 125 patients].,"OBJECTIVE: In literature the diagnostic value of MRI for detecting lesions of the carpal ligaments and the TFCC is judged controversially. The aim of the following study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of direct MR arthrography for depicting and staging of intraarticular lesions of the wrist.MATERIAL AND METHODS: One day before undergoing arthroscopy, 125 patients suffering from wrist pain were examined with direct MR arthrography in a prospective and blinded study. A mixture of contrast medium (iodine-containing contrast medium and gadopentetate in relation 200 : 1) was injected into both radiocarpal and midcarpal joints. The following sequences were acquired on a 1.5T scanner: coronal T1-weighted SE, coronal fat-saturated T1-weighted SE, coronal T1-/T2*-DESS-3D, and sagittal T2*-weighted MEDIC. MRI results were compared with arthroscopic findings using statistical analysis (SEN = sensitivity, SPE = specificity, PPV = positive predictive value, NPV = negative predictive value, ACC = accuracy).RESULTS: In comparison to arthroscopy as the accepted diagnostic gold standard, the following results were found for MR arthrography. Detection of TFCC lesions: SEN 97.1 %, SPE 96.4 %, PPV 97.1 %, NPV 96.4 %, ACC 96.8 %. Detection of complete tears of the scapholunate ligament: SEN 91.7 %, SPE 100 %, PPV 100 %, NPV 99.1%, ACC 99.2%. Detection of partial tears: SEN 62.5 %, SPE 100 %, PPV 100 %, NPV 94.8 %, ACC 95.2 %. Detection of cartilage defects: SEN 84.2 %, SPE 96.2 %, PPV 80 %, NPV 97.1 %, ACC 94.4 %. In total, only three lesions of the lunotriquetral ligament were present.CONCLUSION: Direct MR arthrographic imaging is well suited for detecting intraarticular lesions of the wrist. The presented diagnostic results of MR arthrography are superior to the results of unenhanced MRI reported in the literature. Direct MR arthrography as a reliable diagnostic tool is strongly recommended if lesions of the scapholunate ligament and the triangular fibrocartilage complex are suspected. In contrast, an attitude of caution must be adopted in diagnosing lesions of the articular cartilage of the wrist.",RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,12847645,2003
Internal derangement of the wrist: indirect MR arthrography versus unenhanced MR imaging.,"PURPOSE: To compare indirect magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography with unenhanced MR imaging of the wrist for evaluation of the central disk of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and the scapholunate and lunotriquetral interosseous ligaments.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six wrists were evaluated at MR imaging (41 indirect MR arthrography and 45 unenhanced MR imaging examinations). Three musculoskeletal radiologists independently evaluated the central disk of the TFCC and scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments and compared the results with those of wrist arthroscopy. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each of the readers, and the means were obtained. Sensitivities and specificities were compared with the Student t test.RESULTS: Thirty-three tears of the central disk of the TFCC and 13 scapholunate and 18 lunotriquetral ligament tears were identified at arthroscopy. Sensitivities and specificities were 54%-73% and 83%-91%, respectively, in the evaluation of the central disk of the TFCC, with no significant difference between indirect MR arthrography (P =.666) and unenhanced MR imaging (P =.559). Sensitivities and specificities in the evaluation of the scapholunate ligament were 38%-69% and 75%-99%, respectively, with a significant improvement in sensitivity at indirect MR arthrography (P =.017) and no significant difference in specificity (P =.876). Sensitivities in the evaluation of the lunotriquetral ligament were poor, 0%-22%, though the specificities were 88%-99%, with no significant difference between indirect MR arthrography and unenhanced MR imaging (P =.592 and P =.354, respectively, for sensitivity and specificity.CONCLUSION: Indirect MR arthrography significantly improves sensitivity in the evaluation of the scapholunate ligament when compared with unenhanced MR imaging of the wrist but does not significantly improve the ability to evaluate the central disk of the TFCC or the lunotriquetral ligament.",Radiology,12773676,2003
Results of acute arthroscopically repaired triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries associated with intra-articular distal radius fractures.,"PURPOSE: This study reviews the results of acute repair of peripheral ulnar-sided triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) detachment associated with intra-articular distal radius fractures.TYPE OF STUDY: Two-year follow-up of patients who had undergone acute TFCC repair.METHODS: Fifty-six patients underwent arthroscopically assisted treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures using external fixation and adjunctive percutaneous pinning between 1994 and 1998. Thirteen patients with an acute, complete tear of the ulnar attachment of the TFCC were treated using arthroscopic repair of the TFCC in addition to stabilization of the radius fracture. All patients were evaluated at a mean of 24 months (range, 17 to 35 months) with a physical examination, wrist radiographs, and a Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) module outcome assessment questionnaire.RESULTS: Average wrist flexion, extension, pronation, and supination were 67.3, 61.8, 79.1, and 86.8, respectively. The average grip strength was 78% of the uninjured side. The results of the Gartland and Werley grading system were good to excellent in 12 patients and fair in 1 patient. The DASH outcome scores revealed a mean functional score of 13 and a mean athletic score of 12.

Biomechanical comparison of transosseous and capsular repair of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage tears.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to biomechanically compare the repair strength of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) repairs to the distal ulna using transosseous sutures (group I) versus TFCC repairs to the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon subsheath and surrounding dorsal capsule (group II).TYPE OF STUDY: Cadaveric biomechanical study.METHODS: Six matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric upper extremities were procured. Each underwent the creation and repair of a peripheral, ulnar-sided detachment of the TFCC. Following stabilization of the humerus and radius, the maximum translations of the ulna in the dorsal and palmar directions were measured in response to an 8-lb traction load before disrupting the TFCC, after disrupting the TFCC, and after repairing the TFCC.RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the total translation of the ulna following disruption of the TFCC (P &lt;.001) in both groups. The mean and standard deviation of the percent total translation eliminated following TFCC repair for group I specimens (transosseous suture) were 33.8% and 11.6%, respectively. The mean and standard deviation of the percent total translation eliminated following TFCC repair for group II specimens (capsular implantation) were 59.3% and 29.7%, respectively. The observed difference between the repair groups is not significant (P =.157).CONCLUSIONS: While disruption of the TFCC does significantly increase distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability and repair of the TFCC does significantly restore DRUJ stability, the results of this study do not show a significant biomechanical difference between the 2 TFCC repair techniques in a cadaveric model.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,12671622,2003
[TFCC-lesion. MR arthrography vs. arthroscopy of the wrist].,"In a blinded study from January to July 2000, 125 patients suffering from specific complaints of the wrist were examined with direct MR arthrography prospectively. Within 24 hours an arthroscopy of the wrist was performed. With the MR arthrography in 70 patients or 56% of all patients injury of the TFCC was diagnosed. In 65 patients this could be verified arthroscopically. In the remaining 55 patients no TFCC lesion was diagnosed with the MR arthrography. However lesions were found via arthroscopy in three cases,were MRI findings expected an intact TFCC. In the remaining 52 cases the MRT could exclude a lesion of the TFCC correctly. An agreement of the MRT and arthroscopic results could be determined in 93.6% of the cases (correlation). The diagnosis of a TFCC lesion by means of MRI was correct in 94% of the cases (sensitivity), the exclusion of such lesion in 89% (specificity). Positive or negative predictive values of 91% or 93% were achieved. Since neither a specificity nor a sensitivity of 100% can be reached at the moment, the MR arthrography cannot replace the arthroscopy. However it could be a potent additional tool for wrist diagnosis if intraarticular contrast is used. It can facilitate the diagnostics and the indication for surgery at the ulnocarpal wrist and help to reduce arthroscopic interventions that are only for diagnostic purposes and without any therapeutic consequences. With improvement of the technique of magnet resonance tomography we can expect further increase of accuracy and the clinical use of the MR arthrography in the diagnostic workup at the ulnocarpal wrist.",Der Unfallchirurg,12658336,2003
Outcome study of arthroscopic suturing of ulnar avulsions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex of the wrist.,"INTRODUCTION: Ulnar wrist pain due to a TFCC lesion is frequent. Based on studies of the vascularity, ulnar avulsion can be sutured. Arthroscopic techniques have been designed but results are sparsely published.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 35 patients with an ulnar avulsion of the TFCC. All the patients were treated with an originally designed arthroscopical technique. The evaluation was focused on the subjective and functional ouome. A pain score and a DASH score were used.RESULTS: The general impression was positive with a mean DASH score of 15 points. Two-thirds of the patients had a DASH score totaling less than 20. Twenty-nine patients had a good outcome, six were fair or poor.CONCLUSION: Arthroscopical repair of the TFCC is a reliable and useful technique.",Chirurgie de la main,12491707,2002
Chronic triangular fibrocartilage complex tears with distal radioulna joint instability: A new method of triangular fibrocartilage complex reconstruction.,"From September 1996 to September 1997, 27 adult patients were diagnosed with chronic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears with distal radioulna joint (DRUJ) instability in our clinic. They all received the procedure of TFCC reconstruction with partial extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon combined with or without ulnar shortening. There were 26 males and one female in the study with a mean age of 22.4 years. The follow-up period ranged from 22 to 28 months with a mean of 26.2 months. 24 patients who had positive or zero ulnar variance received the procedure of ulnar shortening. Three patients who had minus ulnar variance only received TFCC reconstruction. After the operation, the DRUJ was fixed by a 2.0 mm K-wire for 4 weeks. All patients underwent a rehabilitation program and they were reexamined at our outpatient department (OPD). The results were graded according to the Mayo Modified Wrist Score. Five of the 27 patients rated their wrists 'excellent', 18 rated 'good', and 4 rated 'fair. Overall, a total of 23 patients (85%) rated satisfactorily and returned to work or sport activities. In the 4 patients rated 'fair', mild pain at work and/or exercise, and mildly limited supination were found; however their grip strength was improved at least by 65% compared to the opposite hand. Therefore, as suggested by this study, TFCC reconstruction with partial ECU tendon combined with the ulnar shortening procedure is an alternative method for chronic TFCC tears with DRUJ instability.",Journal of orthopaedic surgery (Hong Kong),12468868,2002
Early isolated triangular fibrocartilage complex tears: management by arthroscopic repair.,"BACKGROUND: Tears in the traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are generally caused by falling accidents with pronated, hyperextended wrists, or by distraction injuries that pull the ulnar side of the wrist out of place. Tears in the triangular fibrocartilage complex often appear in association with ulnar wrist pain and limited wrist function in work or sport. This study addressed the arthroscopic repair of peripheral tears in the TFCC, in a sample of 37 patients who were undergoing TFCC repair by wrist arthroscopy.METHODS: From September 1996 to February 1999, 37 patients underwent TFCC repair by wrist arthroscopy. The mean follow-up period was 25.6 months (range, 22-28 months), and the patients' average age was 21 years. The study included 30 men and 7 women. All patients had early peripheral TFCC tears and no wrist fractures. The inside-out method was used to repair the tears and the distal radioulnar joint was fixed for 6 weeks using a 2.0-mm Kirschner wire. After operation, patients were rehabilitated, reexamined, and followed up at the clinic. Complications were also recorded.RESULTS: The results were graded with a Mayo Modified Wrist Score. Ten of the 37 wrists were rated excellent, 24 were good, and 3 were fair. Overall, 34 of 37 patients (92%) rated satisfactorily and returned to sporting or work activities. Four patients experienced mild pain during work or exercise. Although motion remained normal for these patients, grip strength on the affected hand was at least 72% of that on the other hand.CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic repair of early peripheral tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex is a satisfactory method of repair.

Anatomical study of the carpal attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"There have been few descriptions of the site of attachment onto the triquetrum, the so-called meniscal homologue, of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). We have investigated the sites of attachment onto the triquetrum of 87 TFCCs collected from embalmed cadavers. All TFCCs were smoothly attached to the triquetrum. In 79 (46 cases, 90%) they were attached to the triquetrum and fifth metacarpal bone, and in eight (5 cases, 10%) they were attached widely on the articular surface of the triquetrum. It is necessary to have accurate positional information about the normal triquetrum and TFCC in order to perform arthroscopy. The meniscal homologue attached to the triquetrum is smooth in almost all cases. In about 10% of joints the TFCC is attached to the lunotriquetral ligament, either partly or completely obscuring the articular surface of the triquetrum.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

[Results of arthroscopic synovialectomy of the wrist].,"In the course of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, isolated synovialitis of the wrist and distal radioulnar joint can be found without simultaneous affection of the extensor tendons. It may be the only manifestation of the disease in the sense of monarthritis or one of few affected sites as in oligoarthritis. With modern medical treatment of disease-modifying drugs, this constellation seems to be more frequent. In this situation, we rather perform arthroscopic synovialectomy than open synovialectomy as long as form and function of the joint are maintained. The distal radioulnar joint may also be approached arthroscopically through the perforation of the TFCC, which is usually encountered. A clinical study was performed to evaluate the results of this procedure concerning function, relief of pain, progression of the disease, and risk of recurrence. Between 1995 and 2000, 22 patients (15 female, 7 male) with an average age of 50 years (range 16 to 74) were operated, in one case both wrists. 19 patients have been reexamined clinically and by X-ray after an average follow-up of 21 months (range 6 to 57 months), three by telephone interview. The results were evaluated according to the Mayo modified wrist score (pain, function, motion, and grip-strength related to the contralateral side) and compared to the preoperative values. In the case of bilateral affection, the score was not applied. Also, the patients' subjective evaluation of the results have been taken into account. Progression of the disease has been checked in the standard preoperative and postoperative X-rays of the wrist graded according to the Larsen scale. Special attention was paid to signs of recurrence. The wrist-score improved significantly from an average of 40 points preoperatively to 69 points postoperatively. Eleven patients estimated their wrists as absolutely good, nine as improved, two as unchanged compared to the preoperative situation. Nine patients reported no pain at all, eleven less pain than before and two no change. 17 patients have been satisfied with the procedure, five not. Radiographic progression of the disease from the preoperative status (Larsen stage 0 to III, exceptionally IV) to postoperative was found in three cases. In 19 cases there was no progression. Recurrence was noted in six cases after an average time of six months; a secondary procedure was necessary in two cases. Wrist motion improved in almost all patients from an average value of extension plus flexion of 83 degrees preoperatively to 99 degrees postoperatively. Conclusion. Arthroscopic synovialectomy of the wrist reduces pain and improves function in most cases. It also improves motion, which is an advantage to the open procedure. Patient acceptance of the procedure is high.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",12203149,2002
Reconstruction of longitudinal stability of the forearm after disruption of interosseous ligament and radial head excision (Essex-Lopresti lesion).,"We have presented a technique for reconstruction of the central band of the interosseous membrane in conjunction with surgical repair of the distal radial joint and radial head prosthesis. With this technique, we address all three anatomic structures that provide longitudinal stability of the forearm, specifically, (1) radial head replacement, (2) interosseous membrane reconstitution, and (3) TFCC repair.",Journal of the Southern Orthopaedic Association,12132853,2002
Computational identification of transcription factor binding sites via a transcription-factor-centric clustering (TFCC) algorithm.,"While microarray-based expression profiling has facilitated the use of computational methods to find potential cis-regulatory promoter elements, few current in silico approaches explicitly link regulatory motifs with the transcription factors that bind them. We have thus developed a TF-centric clustering (TFCC) algorithm that may provide such missing information through incorporation of biological knowledge about TFs. TFCC is a semi-supervised clustering algorithm which relies on the assumption that the expression profiles of some TFs may be related to those of the genes under their control. We examined this premise and found the vicinities of TFs in expression space are often enriched with the genes they regulate. So, instead of clustering genes based on the mutual similarity of their expression profiles to each other, we used TFs as seeds to group together genes whose expression patterns correlate with that of a particular TF. Then a Gibbs sampling algorithm was applied to search for shared cis-regulatory elements in promoters of clustered genes. Our working hypothesis was that if a TF-centric cluster indeed contains many targets of the seeding TF, at least one of the discovered motifs would be the site bound by the very same TF. We tested the TFCC approach on eight cell cycle and sporulation regulating TFs whose binding sites have been previously characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and correctly identified binding site motifs for half of them. In addition, we also made de novo predictions for some unknown TF binding sites.",Journal of molecular biology,12054769,2002
Arthroscopically-assisted reduction of intra-articular fractures and soft tissue management of distal radius.,"Arthroscopy was used to help to reduce intra-articular fractures of the distal radius and treat soft tissue injuries in 33 acute cases. The fractures were treated by reduction under arthroscopic control and percutaneous fixation either with or without external fixation. The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was torn in 18 of 33 patients (54%). All tears were peripheral and were repaired with arthroscopic procedures. Scapholunate (SL) ligament injuries prevailed in six (18%) patients; most of them exhibited instability in the SL joint. They received SL ligament debrided and transfixed with K-wires. Four (12%) of the patients suffered lunotriquetral (LT) ligament injuries; three of them also received transfixation with K-wires. Six (18%) of the patients exhibited chondral fractures. All fractures healed without measurable incongruity of joint surface and at follow-up (24 to 36 months), 11 patients displayed excellent results and 22 patients displayed good results according to the Mayo modified wrist score.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,11901458,2002
The carpal detachment injury of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries were suspected clinically in 22 wrists of 21 patients, but arthrography and MRI assessments of this structure were normal. As conservative therapy for 2 months did not improve their symptoms, wrist arthroscopy was then performed. Although no abnormalities of the TFCC and ligaments were observed, meniscus homologue-like tissue which arose from TFCC was riding on the articular surface of the triquetrum. After resection of this soft tissue with a shaver and a punch, the symptoms disappeared in all cases. The arthroscopic findings suggested that a portion of TFCC that was originally attached to the ulnar side of the triquetrum had become detached.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",11895353,2002
The role of radiocarpal injection arthrography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the radiocarpal joint injection arthrography and magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries.METHODS: Thirteen cases whose main complaints were ulnar wrist pain were given radiocarpal joint arthrography and eight of them were also given magnetic resonance imaging for evaluating the integrity of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.RESULTS: Ten of thirteen cases presented the leakage of contrast medium to distal radioulnar joint from the radiocarpal joint, in whom, 8 were demonstrated triangular fibrocartilage tear on magnetic resonance imaging, and 3 located at radial side, 2 at central, 3 at ulnar side. One of three cases which were demonstrated without the leakage of contrast medium in arthrography were displayed with marked TFCC tear on magnetic resonance imaging.CONCLUSIONS: The wrist arthrography can provide a definite diagnosis for triangular fibrocartilage disruption with higher sensitivity. magnetic resonance imaging not only demonstrates the site of triangular fibrocartilage disruption as the same value as wrist arthrography, but also displays the other related bony and soft tissues changes.",Chinese journal of traumatology = Zhonghua chuang shang za zhi,11834149,2002

Peripheral tears of triangular fibrocartilage complex: results of primary repair.,"In 16 patients with ulnar wrist pain, we performed primary arthroscopic or open repair of the peripheral rim tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) (14 ulnar, 4 volar, and 3 radial tears). The wrist function was assessed before and 1 year after the repair using the Mayo-modified wrist score. The average pain score improved from 9.1+/-8.0 to 21.2+/-6.5, the average functional score from 5.0+/-8.1 to 20.6+/-6.3, the average motion score from 4.7+/-2.8 to 15.6+/-7.3, and the average grip point from 4.4+/-3.5 to 15.6+/-7.7, all with significant differences (P&lt;0.01). Ten of the 17 cases had instability of the distal radioulnar joint and five had recurrent instability after repair.",International orthopaedics,11820450,2002
What happens to the triangular fibrocartilage complex during pronation and supination of the forearm? Analysis of its morphology and diagnostic assessment with MR arthrography.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dynamic morphologic changes of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) during pronation and supination of the forearm using high-resolution MR arthrography in cadavers and to evaluate the impact of these changes on the diagnostic assessment of the normal and abnormal TFCC. DESIGN AND SPECIMENS: High-resolution MR arthrography of 10 wrists of cadaveric specimens was obtained in maximum pronation, in the neutral position, and in maximum supination of the forearm. The structures of the TFCC were evaluated by two musculoskeletal radiologists and correlated with anatomic sections. The position of the forearm that allowed the best visualization of normal structures and lesions of the TFCC was determined.RESULTS: The shape and extent of the articular disc as well as the radial portions of the radioulnar ligaments did not change with pronation and supination. The articular disc was horizontal in the neutral position and tilted more distally to align with the proximal carpal row in pronation and supination. The fibers of the ulnar part of the radioulnar ligaments (ulnar attachment of the articular disc) revealed the most significant changes: their orientation was coronal in the neutral position and sagittal in positions of pronation and supination. The ulnomeniscal homologue was largest in the neutral position and was reduced in size during pronation and supination. The extensor carpi ulnaris tendon was centered in its groove in the neutral position and pronation. In supination this tendon revealed subluxation from this groove. The dorsal capsule of the distal radioulnar joint was taut in pronation, and the palmar capsule was taut in supination. The preferred forearm position for analysis of most of the structures of the TFCC was the neutral position, followed by the pronated position. The neutral position was rated best for the detection of ulnar and radial detachments of the TFCC, followed by the pronated position, except for two central perforations of the TFCC which were best seen with supination.CONCLUSION: The articular disc and the surrounding radial portions of the radioulnar ligaments form a rigid, unified complex with the radius without change in their shape in positions of pronation and supination of the forearm, while the ulnar attachment of the TFCC shows important dynamic changes. The neutral forearm position is the best position to analyze both the normal and the abnormal TFCC.",Skeletal radiology,11810165,2002
"Lunotriquetral arthrodesis, a procedure with a high failure rate.","The authors retrospectively reviewed 29 patients with chronic lunotriquetral ligament tears who were treated with lunotriquentral arthrodesis. Arthrography confirmed the diagnosis in 17 cases, arthroscopy in 18. Associated lesions included 13 TFCC tears and 8 scapholunate ligament tears. The fusion was carried out with staples in 5 cases, a Herbert screw in 17, a Kirschner wire in 6. Bone grafts were used in 24 cases. In 15 cases additional procedures were performed. As for the subjective outcome, 5 patients were fully satisfied, 10 had reservations and 14 were not satisfied; 17 patients would repeat the procedure. The average Pellenberg wrist score for pain and function was 59/80 (0 no symptoms, 80 maximal pain). Mean grip force was 69% of the contralateral side and lateral pinch force was 79%. Flexion loss averaged 24 degrees, and extension loss 21 degrees. Fusion was achieved in 16 cases; nonunion persisted in 13. Twelve important complications were noted. In 17 cases the wrist remained painful; in 19 patients an average of two additional surgical procedures were required. Fusion was obtained in two of seven revision cases; five remained painful. Three patients went on to complete wrist arthrodesis. In the light of these results the effectiveness of this procedure has to be reconsidered compared to other alternatives, such as ligamentoplasty and extended arthrodesis (4 corner).",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,11725568,2001
[Interest in wrist arthroscopy for treatment of articular fractures of the distal radius: report of 27 cases].,"We report our results of treatment of intra articular distal radius fracture assisted by wrist arthroscopy. Twenty six patients (15 men and 11 women) were treated using this technique. All the patients were operated on under regional anaesthesia, the elbow flexed to 90 degrees, and in-line traction applied using &quot;Japanese&quot; fingers traps (4 to 6 kgs). After articular cleansing, reduction under arthroscopic and fluoroscopic control was carried out using K-wires. All fractures were intra articular and in four cases of fractures with four fragments, it was necessary to combine a volar plate with the K-wires. There were 21 associated ligament injuries (seven TFCC tears, four lunotriquetral ligament injuries and ten scapholunate injuries of which four necessitated pinning). Our average follow-up time was 16 months (6-26 months). There was absence of pain in 23 cases and the results were good for wrist motion and strength. We did not experienced any severe secondary displacement. Eighteen excellent, seven good results and one average result were obtained. The quality of these functional and anatomical results seems to be directly linked to the quality of reduction obtained under arthroscopy and the quality of internal fixation carried out under traction.",Chirurgie de la main,11723774,2001
Ulnar shortening after failed arthroscopic treatment of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"Ulnar shortening osteotomy was performed in 11 wrists with ulnar abutment syndrome, after failed arthroscopic surgery on the TFCC (ten debridements, one repair). A delayed union was present in three, a non-union occurred in two, of whom one needed a revision and grafting procedure. According to the Mayo wrist score, only four had an acceptable outcome. Patient's satisfaction was higher: seven were satisfied, four were not. The postoperative wrist pain score was good in ten patients. Overall outcome was not very successful. Problems related to the procedure could be avoided by adapting the technique (oblique osteotomy, palmar placement of the plate, and compression devices). The key statement remains however to us; ulnar sided wrist pain thought to be caused by an ulnar abutment is not necessarily resolved by decompressing the ulnocarpal joint.",Chirurgie de la main,11723772,2001
Combined arthroscopic TFCC debridement and wafer resection of the distal ulna in wrists with triangular fibrocartilage complex tears and positive ulnar variance.,"Because a certain percentage of patients with positive ulnar variance experience incomplete pain relief after triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) debridement alone, we prospectively evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of combining arthroscopic TFCC debridement with arthroscopic wafer resection in such wrists as part of the same surgical procedure. We enrolled 12 patients between July 1998 and July 2000 and performed both subjective and objective assessment at follow-up with a minimum of 6 months and an average of 14 months. Seven posttraumatic and 5 degenerative tears were identified. Preoperative ulnar variance with a pronated grip x-ray averaged 2 mm and ranged between 1 and 4 mm. At final review 8 patients experienced complete pain relief and 4 experienced only minimal symptoms. The ulnocarpal stress test failed to elicit pain in any wrist. Nine patients were very satisfied, and 3 were satisfied. Grip strength improved 8 kg (36%). This procedure should be considered in the treatment of ulnar wrist pain when TFCC tears and positive ulnar variance coexist.",The Journal of hand surgery,11721249,2001
[Indirect MR Arthrography of the wrist in the diagnosis of TFCC-Lesions].,"PURPOSE: The objective of this prospective study was to assess the value of the indirect MR arthrography (MR-AR) of the wrist in the detection of lesions of the TFCC.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Indirect MR-AR was performed in 45 patients (23 f/22 m) with unclear ulnar wrist pain. After i. v. injection of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA and after a motion-phase of the wrist (15 minutes) MRI was performed in a coronal plane. We used a STIR-, a fatsaturated (fs) T1-SE and a 3D-DESS sequence. The images were evaluated by two radiologists using a consensus score. The lesions were assigned to the system of Palmer and correlated with arthroscopy.RESULTS: Indirect MR-AR showed in 35 of 45 patients a lesion of the TFCC, but arthroscopy only revealed a defect in 32 cases. This means three false positive but no false negative assessments by MRI. Using this MRI protocol sensitivity and specificity in the detection of TFCC lesions were calculated as 100 % and 77 %. The accuracy was 93 %. Small degenerative changes of the fibres were most common (Palmer type II A). In trauma patients the ligaments usually showed tears near the insertion at the ulna (Palmer type I B). The sensitivity and specificity was 88 % and 95 % for evaluation of the scapho-lunate (SL) ligament, the accuracy was 93 %. Arthroscopy and MRI did not diagnose any rupture of the lunate-triquetral (LT) ligament.CONCLUSION: Indirect MR-AR is a non-invasive method with a high sensitivity in the evaluation of the TFCC and associated injuries. Therefore, it is an excellent screening procedure to assess the indication for therapeutic arthroscopy.",RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,11704910,2001
Histopathological analysis of Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis: disordered growth plate.,"Leri-Weill syndrome (LWS) is a dominant (pseudoautosomal) skeletal dysplasia with mesomelic short stature and bilateral Madelung deformity, due to dyschondrosteosis of the distal radius. It results from the loss of one copy of the Short Stature Homeobox Gene (SHOX) from the tip of the short arm of the X or Y chromosome. SHOX molecular testing enabled us to evaluate the histopathology of the radial physis in LWS patients with a documented SHOX abnormality. A widespread disorganisation of physeal anatomy was revealed with disruption of the normal parallel columnar arrangement of chondrocytes. Tandem stacking of maturing chondrocytes within columns was replaced by a side-by-side arrangement. The presence of hypertrophic osteoid with micro-enchondromata in the radial metaphysis suggests abnormal endochondral ossification. The Vickers' ligament was confirmed to blend with the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). This histopathological study demonstrates that the zone of dyschondrosteosis in LWS is characterised by marked disruption of normal physeal chondrocyte processes and that a generalised physeal abnormality is present.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,11677662,2001
Origins and insertions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex: a histological study.,"The origins and insertions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) were examined histologically in serially sectioned fresh-frozen cadaver wrists. The radioulnar ligament arose vertically through Sharpey's fibres from a broad area in the ulnar fovea and more horizontally from a narrow area at the base of the ulnar styloid. The floor of the extensor carpi ulnaris sheath also originated firmly from the dorsal side of the fovea of the ulna, through an arrangement of Sharpey's fibres. Loose ulnocarpally oriented fibres, corresponding to a thickened ulnar joint capsule, arose from the hyaline-like cartilage matrix at the tip of the ulnar styloid and inserted onto the triquetrum without Sharpey's fibres. The ulnolunate and ulnotriquetral ligaments originated not from the ulna, but from the palmar side of the TFCC. The insertion of the TFCC into the sigmoid notch of the radius demonstrated a central transition from the fibrocartilaginous disc into hyaline cartilage and a firmer fibroosseous transition of the dorsal and palmar portions of the radioulnar ligament at the periphery.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",11560427,2001
[Primary arthroscopic treatment of TFCC tears in fractures of the distal radius].,"The primary simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of TFCC tears in distal radius fractures is still the exception. We present our results of arthroscopic treatment of these injuries. From January 1998 until September 1999, we treated 21 patients with a type C fracture (AO classification) of the distal radius and one patient with a scaphoid fracture and TFCC tears. The Palmer 1A (n = 5) and 1 C (n = 4) tears have been arthroscopically shaved as well as the meniscal tear (n = 1). The Palmer 1B tears were refixed either in an outside-inside technique (n = 6) or in a new all-inside technique (n = 6). Palmer 1D tears were refixed in the Fellinger technique (n = 5). In the clinical follow-up examination six to fifteen months later, we saw symptoms of ulnar-sided wrist pain only in one case of a Palmer 1B tear treated in an outside-inside technique. Especially the patients treated by the new all-inside technique were free from symptoms of TFCC instability. We conclude, that arthroscopic treatment of TFCC tears in acute radius fractures is possible with good results. The new technique of all-inside repair is minimally invasive and shows good results.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",11518985,2001
[What are the indications for arthroscopic repair of ulnar tears of the TFCC?].,"A clinical study was performed to assess the outcome after arthroscopic repair of ulnar tears of the TFCC of the wrist, and to determine which factors are of importance for the results. From 1994 until 1998, in 23 patients an ulnar tear of the TFCC of the wrist was found and treated by arthroscopic repair (average age 32 years, range 16 to 56, 11 female, 12 male). The articular disc was sutured by inside-outside-technique with 2/0 PDS to the floor of the sixth extensor compartment. 14 to 54 months (mean 27 months) after the operation, 21 patients were reexamined. The results were graded according to the Mayo-modified wrist score. Several factors which might be of influence were correlated to the results by crosstabs including preoperative clinical assessment of stability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), time between trauma and repair, mechanism of injury, associated lesions, details of suturing technique, and the amount of loading of the wrist in daily life. In nine patients, the result was rated as excellent, in five patients good, in four patients fair, and in three patients poor. The average preoperative score was 55.7 points, the average postoperative score was 84 points. The difference was statistically significant as calculated by the paired sample t-test (p &lt; 0.05). In preoperative clinical examinations, 13 DRUJs had been assessed as stable, eight as unstable. In the crosstabulation, a significant correlation was found between excellent results and preoperatively preserved stability of the DRUJ, whereas fair and poor results have often been found with clinically unstable DRUJ. The other factors revealed no correlations with the results. Ulnar tears of the TFCC of the wrist without marked instability of the whole DRUJ can be treated by arthroscopic suturing and satisfactory results can be expected. In case of clinical instability of the joint, it is to be assumed that the lesion extends to structures which cannot be seen and sutured arthroscopically. In these cases, open repair after arthroscopic examination must be considered.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",11518984,2001
[Carpal injuries associated with distal radius fractures. Diagnosis and therapy].,"The frequency of carpal injuries associated with distal radius fractures is often underestimated. Diagnosis of such lesions can be difficult. Important diagnostic steps include conventional X-rays, cinematography of the wrist, MRI, and arthroscopy. Different procedures such as wrist arthrography and CT are of secondary value. An early diagnosis of ligament injuries and instabilities can be obtained through cinematographic examination, whereas injuries to the TFCC are mainly diagnosed by MRI. Arthroscopy provides exact diagnosis as well as therapy, including arthroscopically controlled reposition of centrally depressed fragments of the articular surface of the radius and even treatment of TFCC lesions.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",11518981,2001
The effect of observer experience on magnetic resonance imaging interpretation and localization of triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions.,"This study investigates the effect of experience of the interpreter on the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the presence and anatomic location of a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesion. Fifty-one patients who underwent wrist arthroscopy with preoperative MRI studies were reviewed retrospectively. Two radiologists with different levels of training and experience evaluated the MRI scans in a blinded manner. The sensitivity rates of the 2 observers for detection of TFCC lesions were 86% and 80%. The specificity rates were 96% and 80%. The accuracy rates for prediction of a TFCC tear were 83% and 61% for the 2 observers. The correct location of a TFCC lesion was predicted by the more experienced observer for 12 of 19 central, 3 of 4 radial, and 6 of 12 peripheral lesions. The less experienced observer correctly identified 8 of 19 central, 2 of 4 radial, and 2 of 12 peripheral tears. The overall accuracy rates for prediction of a TFCC lesion and its location were 69% and 37%. Our data indicate that the published accuracy rates for prediction of TFCC lesion location may be reproducible only in very specialized centers.",The Journal of hand surgery,11466652,2001
"[Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist].","Thorough knowledge of small structures in the joints is becoming important as the resolution of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has improved during the past decade. The author discusses the MR anatomy and pathology of three representative structures in the joints of the upper extremities: the labral-ligamentous complex of the shoulder, ulnar collateral ligament(UCL) of the elbow, and triangular fibrocartilage complex(TFCC) of the wrist. The labral-ligamentous complex is composed of the anterior labrum and three glenohumeral ligaments. Because of their similar MR appearance, the labral sulcus is difficult to differentiate from traumatic detachment of the labrum, even with the aid of MR arthrography. Insertion of the UCL to the medial condyle in the growing elbow presents different MR appearances according to age. Acute and chronic UCL tears are commonly seen in elbows with medial tension overload and are well depicted with three-dimensional Fourier transform(3DFT) gradient-echo images. 3DFT images are the most suitable for observation of the TFCC as well. Since abnormally high signals of the articular disc suggestive of tear are often seen in asymptomatic subjects, MR imaging may not reliably be used to differentiate clinically significant tears from asymptomatic defects. In this review article, the author emphasizes developmental anatomy and normal variations in the interpretation of MR images.",Nihon Igaku Hoshasen Gakkai zasshi.

Long-term results after arthroscopic resection of lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"Thirty-five patients with central and radial lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) were treated by arthroscopic resection and debridement. Their median age was 36 years (range 11-52), and preoperative duration of symptoms 18 months (range 4-132). Fall on a hyperextended wrist was the most common injury (n = 15), and nine patients had had a previous fracture of the radius. Eighteen patients had an additional arthroscopic debridement of coexisting chondral lesions. There were no complications. At a median follow up time of 39 months (range 18-58), grip strength was recorded as a median of 94% (range 4-164), flexion-extension sector as 94% (range 50-107), and pronation and supination sector as 100% (range 50-112) of the uninjured side. At follow up eight patients were free of pain, 14 much better, eight somewhat better, five unchanged, and no patient had got worse. The Mayo Modified Wrist Score assessed 13 patients as excellent, 14 good, four fair, and one poor. Thirty-one patients returned to full-time work, and four were unemployed (partly because of reasons not relevant to the operation). Thirty-three patients reported they would have had the same procedure if they had known the outcome of the surgery. We find arthroscopic debridement of central or radial lesions of the TFCC to be safe and reliable with good pain relief.",Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery,11291355,2001

Arthroscopic capsulodesis of the lunotriquetral joint.,"A case series consisting of 20 consecutive patients with persistent ulnar-sided mechanical wrist pain, lunotriquetral interosseous (LTIOL) ligament tears resulting in joint incongruity and increased laxity, and traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears was reviewed. Each patient underwent an arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation (ARIF) of the lunotriquetral joint, arthroscopic disk-carpal (disklunate-ulnocapitate-disktriquetral, DL-UC-DT) ligament plication, and TFCC repair or débridement. There were 12 right wrists and 8 left wrists, of which 12 were dominant. The mean patient age was 33 years; 7 patients had workers' compensation claims and 2 had legal claims. Fourteen patients recalled a specific injury mechanism, such as hyperextension or rotation. The accompanying traumatic TFCC tears were peripheral in 15 and linear radial in 6 patients (one patient had concomitant peripheral and radial linear tears), and in 6 cases, the palmar ulnocarpal extrinsic ligaments were partially torn. The mean preoperative modified Mayo Wrist Score was 50, and at a mean of 3.1 years after surgery, the score had increased to 88. There were 13 excellent, 5 good, and 2 fair results. Four patients had complications, including transient tenderness along the extensor carpi ulnaris and persistent neuritis of a dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. Overall wrist comfort and function, as indicated by the modified Mayo Wrist Scores, improved after arthroscopic stabilization of ulnar-sided wrist injuries (pinning of the lunotriquetral joint, disk-carpal ligament plication, and TFCC repair or débridement).",Clinics in sports medicine,11227702,2001
The innervation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex: nitric acid maceration rediscovered.,"Injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is frequently implicated in the etiology of ulnar-sided wrist pain. This study examines the nervous anatomy of the TFCC using a nitric acid maceration technique and attempts to correlate this information with known tear patterns. Ten fresh frozen cadaveric specimens were studied in detail. Gross dissection of each upper-extremity specimen included removal of all flexor and extensor tendons. After identification and labeling with permanent color of the ulnar nerve, dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve, posterior interosseous nerve, anterior interosseous nerve, and median nerve, an en bloc excision of the distal radioulnar region was performed. Digestion of the soft tissue was performed with nitric acid at sequential concentrations of 50% and 33% for 9 of 10 specimens. The digestion was halted by immersing the specimen in a mixture of 10% formaldehyde and 1% glycerine. After removal of bone, the specimens were fixed in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Nine of the 10 specimens were studied microscopically to determine the contribution of the grossly identified nerves to each zone of the triangular fibrocartilage complex as defined by Palmer's classification of acute TFCC tears. The anterior interosseous, median, and superficial radial nerves did not contribute to the innervation of the TFCC. The intraarticular course of the peripheral nerves could not be defined in the one specimen that was not digested with nitric acid. Nitric acid maceration is a rediscovered technique for identifying the nervous anatomy of soft tissues. The study showed that the triangular fibrocartilage complex is innervated by branches of the posterior interosseous, ulnar, and dorsal sensory ulnar nerves in a fairly consistent manner. Improved treatment of TFCC tears may result from an enhanced understanding of the supporting structures' innervation and mechanical function.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,11176611,2001
Histological anatomy of the triangular fibrocartilage complex of the human wrist.,"The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was studied in serial histological sections of the human wrist to reveal its three-dimensional fine structure. The TFCC consisted of a fibrocartilaginous disc proper and other fibrous components. Three-dimensionally, the distal portion of the TFCC had a hammock-like contour that partially surrounded the carpus; while the proximal ligamentous portion corresponding to the radioulnar ligament connected the radius to the ulna. The radioulnar ligament originated at the ulna from both the fovea and the basistyloid. The fibres first gathered and then bifurcated palmarly and dorsally, enclosing and partially coalescing with the proximal side of the disc before inserting around the distal rim of the sigmoid notch of the radius. The meniscus homologue, which corresponded to the ulnar internal wall of the wrist joint, was derived from a loose synovial fold adapting to the stresses from radioulnar deviation. The distal side of the disc consisted of a dense population of chondrocytes in a collagen matrix, while the proximal side was rather rich in fibres directed radioulnarly. Inside the TFCC were loose connective tissues. The histological arrangement of the TFCC is compatible with its function of supporting the carpus, stabilizing the joints and allowing smooth motion of the wrist.",Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft,11125809,2e3
Anatomical Study of the Distal Radioulnar Joint: Degenerative Changes and Morphological Measurement.,"A study of the degenerative changes in the distal radioulnar joint compared with morphological measurement of that joint using 91 joints of the hand from 51 systemic anatomy cadavers was conducted. X-ray images of the joints of the hand were taken followed by measurement of radial inclination, ulnar variance, volar tilt, sigmoid notch inclination and ulnar seat inclination. Macroscopic observations of the ulnar notch of the radius and surface of the distal radioulnar joint of the ulnar head were made by dividing them into six and nine areas, respectively. These were then used to classify the degree of cartilage degeneration. In addition, the status of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was also observed. Arthropathic changes of the distal radioulnar joint were associated with factors including TFC degeneration and UV(+), SNI(-) and USI(+).",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,11089167,2e3
The proximal ligamentous component of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"The proximal ligamentous component of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was studied anatomically using 15 fresh-frozen cadaver hand forearm specimens. Changes in the length of either side of this component were analysed during forearm rotation with the complete three-dimensional structure of the TFCC preserved. The proximal ligamentous component consists of three portions: dorsal, central and palmar. The dorsal and palmar portions connect the radius and ulna directly. These were recognized in all specimens whereas the central portion was not constant. The morphology of the proximal component was categorized into three types: fan-shaped, V-shaped, and funnel-shaped in five wrists each. Changes in ligament length during forearm rotation were measured using fine wires under slight tension that paralleled the ligaments from origin to insertion. The dorsal and palmar portions demonstrated three trends: the dorsal portion increased in length from supination to pronation whereas the palmar portion increased in length from pronation to supination; the length of the dorsal portion remained almost constant as the palmar portion increased in length from pronation to supination; the length of the palmar portion remained almost constant while the dorsal portion lengthened from supination to pronation. These variations appear to be related to which portion of the ligament was attached nearest to the centre of the ulnar fovea, where the rotational axis of the forearm passes. The portion attaching nearest to the fovea demonstrated a nearly isometric length pattern, whereas the portion which attached at a distance showed greater extensibility. These findings suggest that the proximal component of the TFCC corresponds to a true radioulnar ligament, and the isometric and eccentric fibres act mutually during forearm rotation.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10991819,2e3
The role of arthroscopy in the evaluation and treatment of triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries in athletes.,"Treating athletes with TFCC injuries can be a difficult but very rewarding undertaking. Each athlete has individual priorities and concerns, ranging from general health and fitness for the recreational athlete to earning or potentially earning a living as a professional athlete. It is crucial for the treating surgeon to understand these issues to offer the appropriate treatment options at the appropriate time. Triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries are quite common in athletes because of the high loads placed on the ulnar side of the wrist, especially with ulnar-neutral and positive variance. The goal of treatment for the competitive athlete with a TFCC lesion is to hasten maximal recovery and return the athlete to participation at the pre-injury level of performance. Early wrist arthroscopy and treatment of TFCC pathology in this population is certainly a real and valuable treatment option. As has been stated, &quot;the TFCC is the new frontier of wrist surgery&quot; and arthroscopy has helped blaze the trail to this frontier. Competitive and recreational athletes alike benefit from arthroscopic treatment of their TFCC injuries.",Hand clinics,10955219,2e3
Acute injuries of the distal radioulnar joint.,"Distal radioulnar joint injuries can occur in isolation or in association with distal radius fractures, Galeazzi fractures, Essex-Lopresti injuries, and both-bone forearm fractures. The authors have classified DRUJ/TFCC injuries into stable, partially unstable (subluxation), and unstable (dislocation) patterns based on the injured structures and clinical findings. Clinical findings and plain radiographs are usually sufficient to diagnose the lesion, but axial CT scans are pathognomonic. Diagnostic arthroscopy is the next test of choice to visualize stable and partially unstable lesions. Stable injuries of the DRUJ/TFCC unresponsive to conservative measures require arthroscopic debridement of the TFCC tear, along with ulnar shortening if there is ulnar-positive variance. Partially unstable injuries, on the other hand, are treated with direct arthroscopic or open repair of the TFCC tear, once again, along with ulnar shortening if ulnar-positive variance is present. Unstable injuries include simple and complex DRUJ dislocations. A simple DRUJ dislocation is easily reducible but may be stable or unstable. In complex dislocation, reduction is not possible because there is soft tissue interposition or a significant tear. After the associated injury is dealt with, treatment for complex injuries requires exploration of the DRUJ, extraction of the interposed tissue, repair of the soft tissues, and open reduction and internal fixation of the ulnar styloid fracture (if present and displaced). The early recognition and appropriate treatment of an acute DRUJ injury are critical to avoid progression to a chronic DRUJ disorder, the treatment of which is much more difficult and much less satisfying.",Hand clinics,10955218,2e3
Peripheral tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex cause distal radioulnar joint instability after distal radial fractures.,"The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether peripheral tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in patients younger than the osteoporotic age (males,&lt;60 years; females, &lt;50 years) were related to chronic distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability. Fifty-one patients (27 women) with displaced distal radial fractures were included in the study. The median age was 41 years (range, 20-57 years). Arthroscopy at the time of fracture showed complete or partial TFCC tears in 43 patients (24 had only peripheral tears, 10 had only central perforations, and 9 had combined tears). The 1-year (range, 11-27 months) follow-up period included an interview, physical examination, and radiographic evaluation. Ten of the 11 patients with complete peripheral TFCC tears had DRUJ instability at the follow-up examination compared with 7 of the 32 patients with only partial or no peripheral tears. Patients with instability of the DRUJ had a worse Gartland and Werley wrist score. Instability was not associated with any radiographic finding either at the time of fracture or at the follow-up examination. Initial fracture or nonunion of the styloid was even slightly more common in stable patients.",The Journal of hand surgery,10811750,2e3
[Indication and results of ulna shortening osteotomy in ulnocarpal wrist joint pain].,"The ulnar impaction syndrome is proven to be a common source of ulnar sided wrist pain. Ulna-shortening osteotomy represents a successful therapy for this kind of problem, both congenital or posttraumatic positive ulnar variance. Positive variance resulting from a distal radius fracture needs correct dorsal and radial angulation of the radius. In case of congenital positive variance arthroscopic debridement for decompression of the TFCC should be performed first. The adequate correction of the length is the major problem. Disorders of the distal radioulnar joint may result due to overcorrection. Oblique osteotomy using 7-hole-plates is our preferred treatment.",Der Unfallchirurg,10800382,2e3
The effect of an exogenous fibrin clot on the regeneration of the triangular fibrocartilage complex: an in vivo experimental study in dogs.,"The effect of an exogenous fibrin clot on the regeneration of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was examined in a dog model. In 12 mature dogs, bilateral TFCC resection was performed. The resulting defect was packed with an exogenous fibrin clot (experimental) while the contralateral side was left empty (control). Tissue regeneration was evaluated grossly and histologically at 6, 12, and 26 weeks. At each time period, the regenerated tissue in the fibrin clot-filled defect appeared more mature and more congruent with the adjacent cartilaginous surfaces than did the control (empty) defect. At 26 weeks, the clot regenerated tissue had the histological appearance of a normal TFCC with a homogeneous fibrocartilaginous matrix, regularly oriented collagen fibers, and normal integration with the adjacent support structures of the joint. The results of this study indicate that an exogenous fibrin clot could be used to promote a fibrocartilaginous repair tissue for a resected TFCC. Such therapy could be used in the arthroscopic treatment of TFCC injury and resection in an effort to improve postoperative outcome.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,10705322,2e3
Ulnar variance and its relationship to ligament injuries of the wrist.,An anatomic study on cadavers and a clinico-radiological study on patients were undertaken to verify if ligament injuries of the wrist could be associated with ulnar variance. Neither scapholunate nor triquetrolunate ligament injuries could be related to shorter or longer ulnae. Longer ulnae were associated with significantly more perforations of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).,Acta orthopaedica Belgica,10675935,2e3
Results of repair of peripheral tears in the triangular fibrocartilage complex using an arthroscopic suture technique.,"We present the results of an arthroscopic suture technique for repairing peripheral tears (Palmer type 1 b) of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). The 20 patients included in this study were 15-59 years of age; the most common mechanism of injury was a fall on a hyperextended wrist. After diagnosis of the tear in the TFCC we debrided the synovitis and repaired the tears by an arthroscopic suture technique. At follow up 23-59 months postoperatively, range of movement (sum of flexion-extension) was 90% (range 53%-108%) and grip strength was 83% (range 18%-122%) when compared with the uninjured side. All patients returned to work, though three changed occupations. The arthroscopic suture technique of peripheral TFCC repair produced seven excellent, seven good, four fair, and two poor results (grading based on a Mayo modification of the Green and O'Brien wrist score). As our results are comparable to others, we think that the technique described could be used in the repair of peripheral tears of the TFCC.",Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery,10614755,1999

[The importance of the distal radioulnar joint for reconstructive procedures in malunited distal radius fracture].,"Clinically most patients complain about ulnar sided wrist pain and limited forearm rotation following malunited distal radius fractures. Possible bony reasons consist of intraarticular incongruency, malalignment of the sigmoid notch of the distal radius or the ulna-plus-situation at the wrist level. A persisting luxation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) will present itself with complete loss of forearm rotation. The ligamentous or bony detachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) will lead to instability of the DRUJ. Uncorrected, each of these components will lead to arthrosis of the DRUJ. The presence of arthrosis only allows salvage procedures for the DRUJ and will lead to functional loss.

Arthroscopic resection of the dorsal ganglia of the wrist.,"Arthroscopic ganglion resection provides a means by which dorsal wrist ganglia may be safely resected while avoiding the requisite scar accompanying open resection. Use of the arthroscope provides a much more complete examination of the wrist, allowing assessment of the cause of the ganglion as well as associated intra-articular problems. In a previous pilot study, 50% of patients demonstrated visible intra-articular abnormalities, including SL ligament laxity and perforations, TFCC tears, or chondral degeneration at the radial and triquetral-hamate joints. Use of the shaver within the joint allows the surgeon to directly address the ganglion's site of capsular origin, ensuring that the &quot;one-way valve&quot; mechanism is resected. The authors' initial experience was that the recurrence rate after arthroscopic resection was equal to or lower than after open resection. There is now some suggestion that resection of only the ganglion stalk, without removal of the sac, is feasible, but may yield slightly higher recurrence rates than formal open resection of the sac and stalk. This may be attributed to cases in which the capsular attachment to the SL ligament is debrided without identification and removal of a true stalk. The recurrence rate of a ganglion that has previously recurred also appears to be higher than that of primary resection. The authors look forward to publishing their completed results of an on-going follow-up study comparing open, arthroscopic, and recurrent ganglion resections.",Hand clinics,10451818,1999
Dynamic changes in the shape of the triangular fibrocartilage complex during rotation demonstrated with high resolution magnetic resonance imaging.,"We studied in vivo dynamic changes in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in ten healthy volunteers using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A custom made surface coil, which was specially designed to allow movements of the wrist in all directions, was used in this study. MR images in the axial and coronal planes were acquired at maximum pronation, in the neutral position and at maximum supination. During pronation and supination, little deformity of the disc proper was seen on axial sections. In contrast, the ulnar side of the TFCC around the ulnar styloid process showed obvious dynamic changes. The ulnar head translated palmarly to the radius in supination and dorsally in pronation, while there was little change in the position of the fovea of the ulna in relation to the radius. Considering the three-dimensional structure of the TFCC, these findings suggest that the disc proper is strong enough to support the ulnar carpus with little deformity during rotation and that the triangular ligament twists at its origin. During rotation there is friction between the proximal side of the disc proper and the ulnar head. On coronal sections, the disc proper became thinner in pronation due to increased ulnar variance.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10433450,1999
"Fat suppression magnetic resonance imaging of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. Comparison with spin echo, gradient echo pulse sequences and histology.","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) of the wrist was performed in ten healthy volunteers using spin echo T1-weighted (SE-T1), fast spin echo T2-weighted (FSE-T2), gradient echo T2-weighted (GRE-T2) and fat suppression spin echo T1-weighted (FS-T1) images. The images were obtained in the coronal plane and were compared to the corresponding histological coronal sections obtained from five fresh frozen cadavers. In our analysis, the FS-T1 pulse sequence visualized the details of the TFCC best, followed by the GRE-T2 images. Delineation of the TFCC on the SE-T1 and the FSE-T2 was poor. The coronal morphology of the TFCC represented on the fat suppression image was almost identical to the corresponding histological sections. We conclude that the fat suppression MRI clearly shows the complex structure of the TFCC and is useful for the morphological evaluation of the TFCC.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10190598,1999
[Ulna impaction syndrome therapy: decompressive surgical procedures of the head of the ulna].,"The ulnar impaction syndrome can be defined as the impaction of the ulnar head against the triangular fibrocartilage complex and ulnar carpus. As a result of this pattern, painful degeneration of the TFCC occurs. Wrist arthroscopy offers a certain diagnostic tool. In addition, arthroscopic debridement of the TFCC shows a high success rate of 70 to 80 percent. After failed arthroscopic debridement, ulnar shortening osteotomy reduces ulnar load significantly. Malunion of the radius resulting in posttraumatic ulna-plus variance should be treated by correction osteotomy with lengthening of the radius. If arthrosis of the distal radioulnar joint is combined with ulnar impaction syndrome, the hemiresection procedure of Bowers or the method of Kapandji-Sauvé are the methods of choice.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",9888007,1999
[Instability of the distal radio-ulnar joint].,"Instability of the distal radioulnar joint is caused either by bone deformity, fracture or by ligament deficiency. The logical treatment will consist either in osteotomy, osteosynthesis, or in reconstruction of the ligamentous support. The refixation of the TFCC or the ulnar styloid has been demonstrated to be effective in correcting instability biomechanically and clinically. Near-anatomical TFCC reconstruction should always be striven for, rather than resorting to non-anatomical reconstructive procedures. Nevertheless, great efforts will be necessary in the future in order to better understand biomechanics, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of distal radioulnar joint instability.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",9888006,1999
The triangular fibrocartilage complex: an important component of the pulley for the ulnar wrist extensor.,"The extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon is the only wrist motor tendon that broadly connects with the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) of the wrist. The goal of this study was to determine the biomechanical effect of the TFCC on the function of the ECU. The effect of avulsion of the TFCC on the changes in mechanics of the ulnar wrist extensor tendon was investigated in 8 fresh-frozen cadaver forearms. Excursion of the ECU tendon was continuously recorded over the functional range of wrist extension and ulnar deviation in intact wrists, wrists with ulnar styloid fractures, wrists with TFCC release from the distal ulna, and after excising the distal ECU tendon sheath. The ECU tendon demonstrated a 30% increase in excursion during wrist extension after release of the TFCC from its attachment on the distal ulna. During 60 degrees of wrist extension, excursion of the ECU tendon was 4.8+/-1.9 mm in the intact wrists and 6.3+/-2.0 mm after TFCC release. This change in excursion represented 1.4 mm of bowstringing for the ECU tendon during 60 degrees of wrist extension. Further incision of the distal part of the extensor sheath produced only 6% increase in excursion of the ECU. Results of this study suggest that the TFCC is an important component of the pulley for the ulnar wrist extensor. These findings imply that disturbance of the wrist extensor after TFCC injury may potentially contribute to abnormal loading and force transmission through the ulnar wrist and the TFCC, and support the growing consensus that integrity of the TFCC should be restored in the presence of TFCC injuries.",The Journal of hand surgery,9848547,1998
Ulnar shortening for triangular fibrocartilage complex tears associated with ulnar positive variance.,"Twenty-five patients with triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears associated with ulnar positive variance who did not respond to conservative management were treated by ulnar shortening. The follow-up period averaged 35 months. All patients complained of pain, restricted forearm rotation, and weakness of grip. Arthroscopy was performed in 23 of 25 wrists to assess the status of the TFCC and the degree of the degenerative change of the proximal aspect of the lunate and triquetrum. Arthroscopic findings consisted of 15 class 1 and 8 class 2 tears according to Palmer's classification. When the TFCC showed a traumatic flap tear, only the torn flap was removed arthroscopically. Ulnar shortening averaged 3 mm. Transverse osteotomies healed in all patients at a mean postoperative time of 7 weeks. Twenty-three patients had either complete relief or occasional mild pain of the wrist. Two patients with persistent pain had additional procedures performed. Postoperative x-ray films revealed slight degenerative changes at the distal radioulnar joint in 7 patients. Complications included 1 reflex sympathetic dystrophy and 2 fractures through the osteotomy site after early plate removal. Ulnar shortening is a useful procedure for TFCC tears associated with ulnar positive variance.",The Journal of hand surgery,9763270,1998
The distal radioulnar joint capsule: clinical anatomy and role in posttraumatic limitation of forearm rotation.,"Posttraumatic limitation of forearm rotation can be the result of pathology at any location along the forearm axis. Scar contracture of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) capsule, independent of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), is one of the sources that may influence the pronosupination arc. We dissected the wrists of 8 fresh-frozen cadaver specimens to characterize the precise anatomy, relationships, and dynamic characteristics of the entire DRUJ capsule. Additionally, we performed surgical DRUJ capsulectomy in 9 patients with recalcitrant limited forearm pronosupination that was unattributable to dysfunction at any other anatomic forearm location. We conclude that (1) the DRUJ capsule is a defined entity, separate from the triangular fibrocartilage, that is highly specialized to accommodate the distal ulna in forearm rotation; (2) in patients who have restored osseous anatomy after trauma, but have failed to regain pronosupination after maximal rehabilitation, the DRUJ capsule can be identified as the source of the limitation; and (3) DRUJ capsulectomy can markedly improve the arc of forearm rotation in carefully selected patients.",The Journal of hand surgery,9708371,1998
Wrist arthroscopy for the treatment of ligament and triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries.,"The use of arthroscopy was evaluated in 47 patients who were treated for suspected triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears, scapholunate (SL) tears, and/or lunotriquetral (LT) tears. Wrist arthroscopy was performed using traction and standard portals. Any TFCC tear found was debrided to a stable rim. SL and LT tears were debrided to bleeding bone. The range of follow-up was 1.5 to 50 months (average, 15.4 months). Patient grading was determined usin the Mayo Modified Wrist Score. For the 28 patients with TFCC tears, the results were excellent in 13, good in 8, fair in 2, and poor in 5. For the 23 patients with SL tears, the results were 11, 9, 1, and 2, respectively. Of the 5 patients with LT tears, 1 result was excellent, and 4 were poor. Workers compensation did not affect results. Arthroscopic debridement of SL and TFCC tears has proven effective. Debridement of LT tears has not been as successful. Based on our results, we feel that arthroscopic debridement of SL and TFCC tears is warranted.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,9681539,1998
"Wrist arthrography after acute trauma to the distal radius: diagnostic accuracy, technique, and sources of diagnostic errors.","RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this investigation was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of wrist arthrography in the detection of interosseous ligament disruptions and of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions in patients after acute wrist trauma and to define the sources of diagnostic error of wrist arthrography after recent trauma.METHODS: Twenty-two patients with radial fractures after acute wrist trauma underwent arthrography and arthroscopy of the wrist. Arthrography was performed in a standardized manner by two- or three-compartment injection technique. Subsequently wrist arthroscopy was performed within the same session. Image analysis included the evaluation of interosseous carpal ligaments, the TFCC, and the osseous structures.RESULTS: In 22 patients, 11 injuries of the intrinsic ligaments and the TFCC were diagnosed by arthroscopy, of which 9 had been diagnosed correctly with arthrography before surgery. One scaphoid fracture previously missed on conventional radiographs also could be diagnosed by arthrography.CONCLUSION: Arthrography of the posttraumatic wrist is a valuable tool in the diagnostic evaluation of interosseous carpal ligaments and the TFCC.",Investigative radiology,9609486,1998

Reconstruction of the interosseous membrane of the forearm in cadavers.,"The biomechanical function of the interosseous membrane of the forearm was examined in 12 fresh cadaver forearms. The strain in the central band of the interosseous membrane was found to be greatest in full pronation and was significantly increased with excision of the radial head. The proximal/distal location of the lunate fossa of the radius with respect to the ulna was measured and was found to be most distal in supination and most proximal in pronation, in both the intact specimen and after excision of the radial head. Serial sectioning of the interosseous membrane and the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) demonstrated that both the central band and the TFCC are important to the axial stability of the forearm. Reconstruction of the central band, using a graft based upon the flexor carpi radialis, was performed in all 12 specimens after the interosseous membrane and the TFCC were sectioned. It was successful in preventing complete migration of the radius to the capitellum, but it was not capable of completely restoring the longitudinal stability of the forearm. Central band reconstruction as described here has not been performed in the clinical setting and is not advocated for clinical application at this time.",The Journal of hand surgery,9471065,1998
Arthroscopic diagnosis of intra-articular soft tissue injuries associated with distal radial fractures.,Arthroscopy was used to assess the soft tissue injuries associated with distal radial fractures in 118 acute intra- and extra-articular fractures. The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was torn in 46 of 118 patients--in 35% of intra-articular fractures and in 53% of extra-articular fractures. No correlation between ulnar styloid fractures and TFCC injuries could be found. Scapholunate (SL) ligament injuries with instability were present in 21.5% of intra-articular fractures and in 6.7% of extra-articular fractures. Lunotriquetral (LT) ligament injuries with instability were present in 6.7% of intra-articular fractures. and in 13.3% of extra-articular fractures. Combined SL and LT injuries were present in 5.6% of intra-articular fracture. Preoperative radiographs correlated with TFCC injury. Patients with TFCC tears had greater shortening and dorsal angulation on the preoperative radiographs. Preoperative radiographs had no predictive value for interosseous ligament injury. Ligamentous injuries are commonly associated with both intra-articular and extra-articular distal radial fractures.,The Journal of hand surgery,9330132,1997
Operative technique for inside-out repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,A technique for arthroscopic inside-out repair of peripheral traumatic (type 1B) tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex is reported. The technique can be performed using zone-specific cannulas that are commonly used for repairing meniscal tears in the knee. Anatomic dissections were used to show the safe regions around the TFCC where tears are amenable to this type of repair.,The Journal of hand surgery,9330138,1997
Ulnar shortening combined with arthroscopic repairs in the delayed management of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"The functional outcome after surgery was determined in 21 patients an average of 29 months (range, 24-52 months) after surgery to evaluate the efficacy of arthroscopic repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears and ulnar shortening. All of the patients had reparable lesions of the TFCC treated after a delay of more than 6 months from the time of injury. The patients' average age was 32 years and all patients had wrist pain limiting them from work and/or sports prior to surgery. After surgery, there was a significant relief of pain (p &lt; .01). Grip strength and range of motion averaged 83% +/- 18% and 81% +/- 16%, respectively, of that of the uninjured side. At follow-up evaluation, 14 patients with repairs underwent follow-up studies; the TFCC was noted to be intact in 12 patients.",The Journal of hand surgery,9330137,1997
Ulna-shortening osteotomy after failed arthroscopic debridement of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"Over a 4-year period, 160 wrist arthroscopies were performed at 1 institution. Ninety-seven patients had central or nondetached ulnar peripheral tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). All these patients underwent debridement with an arthroscopic shaver. Thirteen of the 97 had persistent pain in the TFCC region for more than 3 months after surgery. At an average of 8 months after failed arthroscopic debridement of the TFCC, all 13 patients underwent a 2-mm-long ulna-shortening osteotomy with fixation by a 3.5-mm 6-hole dynamic compression plate. At follow-up examination (an average of 2.3 years later), 12 of the 13 had complete relief of pain at the ulnar side of the wrist. One patient continued to complain of pain with moderate to heavy activity use of her hand. Four of the 13 had postoperative complications: 1 had traumatic pull-out of the screws requiring reinsertion and distal radius bone graft, 1 had nonunion at 4 months after surgery that required iliac crest bone graft, and 2 had pain necessitation hardware removal. All 4 of these patients had no further problems at final follow-up evaluation. There was no statistically significant difference between the arthroscopic debridement alone cohort and the arthroscopy/ulna-shortening subgroup relative to ulnar variance or incidence of associated lunotriquetral ligament tears. On the basis of these findings the authors recommend a 2-mm-long ulna-shortening osteotomy for patients whose previous arthroscopic debridement for central or nondetached peripheral TFCC was unsuccessful in eliminating ulnar-sided wrist pain.",The Journal of hand surgery,9260628,1997
Arthroscopic repairs of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"Technical advancements in arthroscopic wrist procedures have improved our knowledge of normal and abnormal intraarticular wrist function. Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears from trauma injuries are a common source of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Fortunately, the TFCC is a structure that can be evaluated and treated arthroscopically with results that are comparable to open surgical procedures. Successful arthroscopic repairs of TFCC tears depend on a coordinated team effort between perioperative nurses, orthopedic surgeons, nurse practitioners, and occupational hand therapists, as well as cooperation from patients and family members. This article reviews the anatomy and physiology of the TFCC, the biomechanics of the wrist and mechanisms of injury, and arthroscopic repairs of TFCC tears.",AORN journal,9220068,1997
Radial avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex in acute wrist trauma: a new technique for arthroscopic repair.,"The advantages of arthroscopically assisted treatment of intraarticular distal radius fractures, especially the detection of additional carpal lesions, also focus attention on special surgical techniques for operating on these injuries within the same session. When we consider the biomechanical situation, various kinds of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions, and their arthroscopic aspects, there are probably two possibilities for surgical treatment that are similar to arthroscopic meniscal surgery: resection of flap tears and the refixation of peripherally disinserted TFCC. Avulsions from the ulnar styloid or from the ulnar collateral ligament and the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon can easily and satisfactorily be treated by convenient arthroscopic suture techniques, whereas the reattachment of the triangular disc in the sigmoid notch is very tricky. This problem is solved by a recently developed procedure using the so-called T-Fix-device (Acufex), which provides the possibility of transosseus refixation by closed arthroscopic procedure and therefore guarantees the principle of minimal invasive surgery.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,9195037,1997
Arthroscopic repair of peripheral avulsions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex of the wrist: a multicenter study.,"A multicenter study to assess arthroscopic reconstruction of the peripheral attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex was undertaken. A total of 44 patients (45 wrists) from three institutions were reviewed. Twenty-seven of the 45 wrists had associated injuries, including distal radius fracture (4), partial or complete rupture of the scapholunate (7), lunotriquetral (9), ulnocarpal (2), or radiocarpal (2) ligaments. There were two fractured ulnar styloids and one scapholunate accelerated collapse (SLAC) wrist deformity. The peripheral tears were repaired using a zone-specific repair kit. The patients were immobilized in a munster cast, allowing elbow flexion and extension, but no pronation or supination for 4 weeks, followed by 2 to 4 weeks in a short arm cast or VersaWrist splint. All patients were reexamined independently 1 to 3 years postoperatively by a physician, therapist, and registered nurse. The results were graded according to the Mayo modified wrist score. Twenty-nine of the 45 wrists were rated excellent. 12 good, 1 fair, and 3 poor. Overall, 42 of the 45 patients (93%) rated as satisfactory and returned to sports or work activities. One patient had chronic pain, and two patients had ulnar nerve symptoms, although motion was normal in all, and their grip strength was at least 75% of the opposite hand. Arthroscopic repair of peripheral tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is a satisfactory method of repairing these injuries.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,9043608,1997
Isolated tears of the triangular fibrocartilage: management by early arthroscopic repair.,"To evaluate the efficacy of arthroscopic repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears treated within 4 months after injury, functional outcome after repair was determined following arthroscopic repair in 24 patients. The patients' average age was 31 years (range, 22-38 years); the average follow-up period was 34 months (range, 26-48 months). All patients had wrist pain limiting their participation in work prior to surgery. Patients with central attrition tears identified by arthroscopy were excluded from the study. Twenty-three patients had a preoperative arthrogram. Twelve of the patients with positive arthrogram findings had an avulsion of the TFCC from the sigmoid notch (Palmer type 1D tears). Of the eleven patients with negative arthrograms, 10 had ulnar tears in capsular attachments of the TFCC. The ulna variance averaged 0.2 mm +/- 0.6 mm. Separate arthroscopic techniques were developed for reattaching the TFCC to the radius (nine patients) versus to the peripheral capsule on the volar or ulnar side of the wrist (eight patients). Postoperatively, there was a significant relief of pain (p &lt; .01). Postoperative range of motion averaged 89% +/- 9% SD of the contralateral side, and grip strength averaged 85% +/- 20% SD of the contralateral side. Thirteen of the 19 patients returning to work did so in their original jobs.",The Journal of hand surgery,9018613,1997
New Tuohy needle technique for triangular fibrocartilage complex repair: preliminary studies.,"The treatment of injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) has evolved from closed casting through open excision to arthroscopic repair. The authors present the preliminary results of arthroscopic repair of peripheral (Palmer type IB) TFCC tears using a Tuohy needle. Results in 17 patients treated with this technique were obtained retrospectively through chart review and telephone interview. Average age of the patients was 33 years (range, 16 to 54 years). Conservative treatment averaged 9 months (range, 2 to 26 months). The repairs were performed with one or two horizontal mattress sutures of 2-0 polydioxanone. Follow-up ranged from 4 to 13 months (average, 8 months). Sixteen patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the result; 1 was not satisfied. No complications occurred. We believe this Tuohy needle technique is practical and cost-effective for the arthroscopic management of peripheral TFCC tears.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,9115558,1996
Functional anatomy of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"The functional anatomy of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was investigated in 20 fresh cadavers. Dynamic changes in the TFCC during rotation were also examined from both the proximal and distal aspects. In our analysis, the TFCC was separated into three components. The distal component was stable, functioning like a hammock to suspend the ulnar carpus. The proximal component was the fan-shaped triangular ligament, the true radioulnar ligament. This was found to originate from the fovea of the ulna in a vertical fashion and was easily twisted during rotation. The third component, the ulnar collateral ligament, also twisted during rotation. When analysed by coronal section, the internal portion of the TFCC was found to be loose, and probably serves as a cushion to absorb local deformities in the TFCC during rotation.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",9230938,1996
Arthroscopic repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"To evaluate the efficacy of arthroscopic repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), functional outcome was determined after arthroscopic repair of 22 wrists in 21 patients. Average follow-up was 36 months (range, 26 to 48 months) and the patients' average age was 30 years (range, 22 to 38 years). All patients had wrist pain limiting them from work or any sports. Twelve of the 14 patients with positive arthrograms had an avulsion of the TFCC from the sigmoid notch (Palmer type 1D tears). Of the 6 patients with negative arthrograms, 5 had peripheral tears (Palmer type 1B). Five patients had associated lunotriquetral ligament repairs and 7 had ulna shortening osteotomies. There was a significant relief of pain and increase in work and sports activities (P &lt; .01). Postoperative range of motion averaged 86% +/- 9% of the contralateral side and grip strength averaged 82% +/- 20% of the contralateral side. There was a significant correlation between the delay from injury to surgical repair and the final total range of motion and grip strength. Follow-up studies in 15 patients found that the repairs were intact in 12. Arthroscopic repair results in significant relief of pain and an increase in the ability to perform at work or sports.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,8902134,1996
[Arthroscopic image of wrist joint instability].,"In a consecutive series of 107 arthroscopies, 88 wrists showed a ligamentous lesion on the ulnar side. The TFCC was affected in 90% (79 patients), the triquetrum in 53% (47 patients), the ulnocarpal ligaments in 22% (19 patients) and the hamate in 17% (15 patients). The number of ligament injuries averaged three per wrist. Surprisingly, there were multiple lacerations noted in 22% of the TFCC and these occurred in characteristic combinations.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",9026487,1996
[Ulnodorsal impingement syndrome: meniscus lesions of the wrist].,"In a consecutive series of 166 wrist arthroscopies, a lesion of the meniscus was found in 16 patients. All of them complained of ulnar wrist pain evoked by axial load in extension. 14 patients had previous wrist trauma. The preoperative physical examination showed marked ulnodorsal tenderness on palpation and the examiner could feel crepitation by passive motion in the radial-ulnar direction. The meniscus represents a part of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). At this time it is not possible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate between articular disc and meniscus lesion. In contrast the two structures are clearly identifiable by arthroscopy especially if there is a radial tear through the meniscus or even a complete avulsion from its insertion on the palmar aspect of the triquetrum. The avulsed part of the meniscus can prolapse into the ulnocarpal joint, causing an impingement phenomenon.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",9026486,1996
"[Radiologic skeletal diagnosis: traumatology of the distal forearm, the wrists and the hand].","Plain X-ray films including some special radiographic views are still the basis of the radiological evaluation of injuries of the distal forearm, the wrist, and the hand. Especially in the diagnosis of fractures of the distal radius the exact positioning of the arm and hand is essential. For the description of fractures of the distal forearm the AO classification of fractures should be used, which is comprehensive and universally applicable. Conventional tomography and computed tomography (CT) of the radio-ulnar joint and the wrist are used in patients with persisting complaints or equivocal findings on plain radiographs, and difficult anatomical situations. Suspected ligamentous injuries of the wrist including tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are evaluated by wrist arthrography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the latter requiring a highly skilled imaging and interpretation technique. MRI is the method of choice for the detection of osteonecrosis. Ultrasound examination are of minor importance in the work up of wrist and hand injuries.",Aktuelle Radiologie,8924448,1996
Arthroscopic repair of radial-sided triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,Treatment of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears is receiving considerable attention. Repair of peripheral tears of the TFCC has been recommended to restore the important functions of stability and load-bearing. Techniques for the reattachment of the periphery of the TFCC are evolving. Previous reports have mainly dealt with ulnar-sided (Palmer Class I-B) repairs. This report describes an arthroscopic technique for repair of radial-sided (Palmer Class I-D) TFCC tears. The procedure utilizes arthroscopic visualization with direct reattachment of the radial edge of the horizontal disk of the TFCC into the sigmoid notch of the distal radius. Fixation is achieved using sutures driven through the distal radius using long straight meniscal repair needles. Early clinical results following arthroscopic reattachment of radial-sided TFCC tears using this technique have been favorable. The technique is presented as an alternative method for repair of these lesions.,Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,8783830,1996
Clinical results of treatment of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears by arthroscopic debridement.,"In order to determine indications for arthroscopic debridement and the management of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears, we reviewed 16 wrists retrospectively. The mean patient age was 30 years, with a range of 20 to 53 years. The follow-up period averaged 35 months. Two groups were identified: post-traumatic tears (n = 11) and degenerative tears (n = 5). The results of arthroscopic debridement were compared and analyzed based on the preoperative and postoperative evaluation of pain, range of motion, grip strength, return to work, patient acceptance, and complications. Failures were further evaluated to determine identifiable lesions or anatomic defects associated with poor results. Patients with positive ulnar variance and lunotriquentral interosseous ligament tears had a poor clinical outcome. Good results correlated with grip strength; all patients with post-traumatic TFCC tears had excellent results, while those with degenerative TFCC tears did poorly.",The Journal of hand surgery,8724470,1996
Arthroscopic treatment of triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions of the wrist.,"The arthroscopic treatments (suture, debridement and &quot;wafer&quot; resection of the distal ulna) performed for TFCC lesions in 42 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Overall results were disappointing, with a better outcome for isolated lesions, for sutured TFCC's and degenerative lesions.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,8669264,1996
MR imaging interpretation of the Palmer classification of triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions.,"The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is a complex anatomic and biomechanical structure. Injury to the TFCC is a recognized cause of ulnar wrist pain. The TFCC may be injured in its horizontal portion, in its peripheral portions, or at its attachments. In the Palmer classification, TFCC lesions are categorized as traumatic or degenerative. Traumatic lesions are subclassified according to the location of the injury; degenerative lesions are subclassified according to the extent of degeneration. This classification is helpful in determining the mechanism of injury and directing clinical management. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may be more useful than arthrography in prospective evaluation of TFCC lesions. MR images accurately demonstrate the structural abnormalities that contribute to ulnocarpal instability and pain. The presence or absence of chondromalacia is a factor in the Palmer classification and is also considered in treatment planning. However, only advanced cases of chondromalacia are reliably detected with MR imaging.","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",10946693,1996
Acute dislocations of the distal radioulnar joint.,"An injury to the DRUJ can occur in association with almost any fracture of the forearm or as an isolated phenomenon. A dislocation of this joint may be simple or complex. Constant awareness must be maintained during treatment of injuries of the wrist, forearm, and elbow if common pitfalls are to be avoided. Failure to diagnose and treat a complex DRUJ dislocation will lead to chronic, persistent subluxations or dislocations, or both, and to symptomatic osteoarthrosis. Failure to recognize a simple dislocation of the DRUJ associated with a fracture of the forearm may result in inappropriate or inadequate immobilization of the dislocated joint after internal fixation of the fracture. As a consequence, the injured TFCC may not heal, leading to recurrent post-operative instability. After either a simple or a complex dislocation of the DRUJ has been recognized, the treatment is relatively straightforward and rewarding. Despite the severity of these injuries, with proper diagnosis and management most patients will have a satisfactory outcome.",Instructional course lectures,8727719,1996
Evaluation of chronic wrist pain. Arthroscopy superior to arthrography: comparison in 39 patients.,"39 patients with chronic wrist pain underwent arthrography and arthroscopy to reveal disruptions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and/or interosseous ligaments. TFCC disruption was diagnosed arthroscopically in 15 cases of which arthrography revealed the disruption in only 7. In 3 other patients, arthrography showed rupture of the TFCC: however, arthroscopy showed no defects. Rupture of an interosseous ligament was diagnosed arthroscopically in 6 patients in all of whom it was also revealed by arthrography. In 6 other patients, arthrography showed disruption of an interosseous ligament not verified by arthroscopy. We conclude that arthroscopy is superior to arthrography for diagnosing chronic wrist pain.",Acta orthopaedica Scandinavica,8553825,1995
Arthroscopic treatment of triangular fibrocartilage tears.,"Lesions of the TFCC are more frequently implicated as a cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Accurate diagnosis of TFCC pathology must be based on a thorough history and physical examination. Imaging modalities of particular use include plain radiographs, triple compartment arthrography, and MR imaging. The most sensitive and accurate diagnosis of the extent as well as the clinical significance of intra-articular pathology on the ulnar side of the wrist is by means of the arthroscope. With the advent of smaller and more elaborate arthroscopic instrumentation, the ability to perform arthroscopic surgery on the TFCC has dramatically increased over the past decade. The present arthroscopic treatment of traumatic central and radial lesions consists of debridement of unstable flaps, whereas dorsal and ulnar-sided lesions can be directly repaired. Centrally located degenerative perforations can be debrided in conjunction with an arthroscopic wafer procedure on the distal ulna.",The Orthopedic clinics of North America,7566916,1995
Triangular fibrocartilage complex: normal appearance on coronal three-dimensional gradient-recalled-echo MR images.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the usefulness of three-dimensional gradient-recalled-echo (GRE) sequences in demonstration of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Appearance of the TFCC in wrists of 11 cadavers, 17 patients, and six volunteers at three-dimensional GRE magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was evaluated and compared with that at dissection.RESULTS: MR appearance of the TFCC was similar for all wrists. Volar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments were identified. The TFCC had two types of attachments to the ulna: The more common consisted of two striated attachments, one to the tip and the other to the base of the styloid; the less common consisted of a broad-based striated attachment along the styloid. MR appearance of the ulnotriquetral and ulnolunate ligaments and meniscus homologue varied but correlated with observations at dissection.CONCLUSION: The three-dimensional GRE sequence consistently demonstrated most TFCC components. Dissection helped confirm MR-demonstrable variability in the ulnar aspect of the TFCC.",Radiology,7724777,1995
Clinical applications of MR imaging in hand and wrist surgery.,"MR imaging is emerging as an invaluable tool in the diagnosis of hand and wrist disorders. It is extremely accurate in the diagnosis of stage 1 Kienbock's disease when plain radiographs are equivocal and in evaluating bone and soft-tissue tumors of the hand and wrist. MR imaging is replacing arthrography as the imaging modality of choice for disruptions of the TFCC. With refined technology and improved resolution, abnormalities involving the intercarpal ligaments ultimately will be able to be detected with a high degree of precision.",Magnetic resonance imaging clinics of North America,7553028,1995

A new technique of reattachment after traumatic avulsion of the TFCC at its ulnar insertion.,"One female and seven male patients (median age 25.5) presented with traumatic avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), type 1B according to Palmer's classification. Reattachment of the TFCC near its anchoring point was combined with an intraarticular shortening osteotomy of the ulnar head. This provides an excellent approach to the TFCC and a well vascularized anchoring surface. The mooring point is biomechanically appropriate and the tissues with the best biomechanical properties are used. The functional results with a mean follow-up of 3 years were encouraging, as demonstrated by the significant improvement of pain (P = 0.017). All patients were able to return to their previous occupation; no further surgery was necessary to the distal radio-ulnar joint and no impairment of pronation and supination was detected. The final wrist score reflects the subjective results defined by the patient. However the correlation is not linear and the wrist scores are superior to the degree of satisfaction defined by the patient.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",7797966,1995
[Triangular fibrocartilage complex: functional anatomy and histology].,"The functional anatomy and histology of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) were investigated using 20 wrists from fresh cadavers, and a functional model of TFCC was proposed. The dynamic changes in the TFCC during pronation and supination were examined from both the proximal and distal sides. The distal side of the TFCC consisted of the disc proper (DP), the meniscus homologue (MH), the ulnolunate ligament (UL), and the ulnotriquetral ligament (UT). The prestyloid recess was observed between the DP and MH. The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) existed at the ulnar side of the TFCC and consisted of the sheath floor of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) with relatively loose ligamentous tissue recognized as 6U-portal in arthroscopy. The fan-shaped triangular ligament spreading from the fovea of the ulna was observed on the proximal side of the TFCC. It was considered to be the real radioulnar ligament connecting the radius and ulna. During pronation and supination, little deformity in the DP was observed, while the ulnar insertion of the triangular ligament was twisted. The UCL was distorted dorsally in pronation and volary in supination. In the coronal section of the TFCC, the area surrounded by the DP, MH and UCL was relatively soft and loose, and was considered to have served as a cushion during pronation and supination. From these findings, the TFCC was separated into three components; the distal component which acted like a hammock to suspend the carpus, the triangular ligament as the proximal component which stabilized the radius to the ulna, and the UCL as the ulnar component which stabilized the carpus to the ulna. We have proposed a suspension theory to account for the stability and mobility of the TFCC during pronation and supination when these three components suspend each other. The function of the TFCC can be fully accounted for by our theory.",Nihon Seikeigeka Gakkai zasshi,7782655,1995
Treatment of acute injuries of the triangular fibrocartilage complex associated with distal radioulnar joint instability.,"One hundred thirty patients who had an injury of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) with distal radioulnar joint (DRU) instability were treated operatively. The TFCC injury with DRUJ instability occurred as an isolated lesion in 20. After appropriate fracture stabilization, 86 patients were treated with closed reduction of the DRUJ and radioulnar transfixation with one to two Kirschner wires with the forearm in neutral rotation. In 19 patients the avulsed ulnar styloid was internally fixed, and the DRUJ supplemented with radioulnar transfixation. In 13 patients the ulnar styloid was internally fixed. In 12 patients with radial avulsion fractures the displaced bony fragment was percutaneously fixed with a Kirschner-wire. Postoperatively all the patients were immobilized in a long arm cast in neutral rotation for 6 weeks. The results were excellent in 95%, fair in 30, and poor in 5.",The Journal of hand surgery,7775777,1995
The role of arthroscopy in the treatment of traumatic triangular fibrocartilage injuries.,The triangular fibrocartilage complex is a complex anatomic structure located at the ulnar aspect of the wrist and is important to the stability and biomechanical function of the ulnar carpus and distal radioulnar joint.

Incidence of cartilaginous and ligamentous lesions of the radio-carpal and distal radio-ulnar joint in an elderly population.,"51 wrists of 30 embalmed cadavers have been used to perform an anatomical and radiological study relating cartilaginous and ligamentous lesions of the wrist with sex, age, ulnar variance (UV) and the state of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in an elderly population (mean 76.6 years). Two-thirds of all wrists (66%) showed cartilaginous lesions, mainly on the lunate (22, or 44%). The TFCC was perforated in 23 wrists (46%), and most were central degenerative perforations. Correlations were found between ulnar variance and TFCC thickness (P &lt; 0.05) and ulnar variance and TFCC perforations (P &lt; 0.05). A significant relation was observed between age and proximal row intercarpal ligamentous ruptures (P &lt; 0.05) and between age and ulnar variance (P &lt; 0.05). No statistical correlation was seen between ulnar variance and cartilaginous lesions on the lunate (P &lt; 0.05) in this slightly ulnar negative population (mean-0.37 mm).","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",7822912,1994
Injuries of the distal radioulnar joint.,"Injuries of the distal radioulnar (DRU) joint are common. If the joint is unstable or discongruous, attempts should be made to restore anatomic alignment and stability. Although most acute injuries of the DRU joint are easily treated, they are often overlooked or misdiagnosed because they usually occur in association with other major injuries of the upper limb. Acute and chronic abnormalities are described briefly and the treatment for each is discussed. Appropriate diagnosis and management of the acute injury will yield a much higher success rate than reconstructive procedures to correct a chronic disorder. A differentiation should be made between DRU joint dysfunction and ulnar impingement against the carpus; ulnar shortening is the most commonly used technique to treat the latter condition. In an elderly patient, a Darrach procedure is the preferred treatment for a DRU joint dysfunction; in younger patients, the treatment of choice appears to be resection arthroplasty of the DRU joint with preservation of the ulnar length, the ulnar styloid, and the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). In cases of malunion of the distal radius with involvement of the DRU joint, the recommended treatment is corrective osteotomy and soft tissue reconstruction of the ligamentous support of the joint.",Contemporary orthopaedics,10150245,1994
Arthroscopic diagnosis of ligament lesions of the wrist.,"144 patients with post-traumatic wrist pain but normal standard radiographs were examined by wrist arthroscopy. Ligamentous lesions were observed in 75 patients. TFCC lesions, classified according to the Palmer classification and including lunato-triquetral interosseous ligament lesions, were seen in 61, and scapho-lunate interosseous ligament lesions in 14 patients. Degenerative TFCC changes were equally common in patients younger than 40 years of age but significantly more common with more than 2 years duration of symptoms. Varying degrees of instability were noted in patients with scapho-lunate interosseous ligament lesions but no associated ligament lesions were observed. Because of the variety of pathological changes arthroscopy is recommended in the management of patients with post-traumatic wrist pain.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",7964104,1994
Anatomical and radiological evaluation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex of the wrist.,"109 wrists from 69 cadavers (mean age 74 years) have been studied to clarify the pathology and morphology of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and to correlate pathological and radiological findings. Perforation of the TFCC was observed in 65% of the specimens and was considered to be secondary to a degenerative process, because it was often accompanied by degenerative changes in the ulnar carpal bones and perforation of the lunotriquetral ligament. To detect TFCC perforations on plain postero-anterior radiographs, it is important to evaluate ulnar plus variance and degenerative changes in the ulnar carpus. Existence of ulnar plus variance alone is more sensitive but less specific in detection of TFCC perforation than the existence of degenerative changes in the ulnar carpus.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8077819,1994
Reconstruction of the dorsal ligament of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"The distal radio-ulnar ligaments (DRUL) are key components of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). The dorsal DRUL tightens during pronation of the forearm and helps to stabilize this motion. 12 women and three men at our clinic have been treated for DRUJ instability secondary to dorsal DRUL rupture or attenuation. Their chief complaint was pain. The dorsal DRUL was reconstructed using a tendon graft, the ends of which were anchored in the bone of the radius and ulna.

Articular cartilage wear of varying severity was seen on the distal radial and ulnar articular surfaces in 27% of cases and on the proximal row articular surfaces in 54%. Wear was most commonly seen on the radial styloid and corresponding area of the scaphoid. The triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) was found to be degenerate or torn in 24%. Central degenerative perforation was commonly associated with articular cartilage wear on the ulnar head and the ulnar half of the lunate. No significant wear pattern was seen in those wrists with peripheral linear (i.e. traumatic) TFCC tears. Interosseous scapho-lunate and luno-triquetral ligament disruptions were found in less than 10%, suggesting that disruption of these ligaments is usually traumatic and not degenerative.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8077817,1994
The role of the interosseous membrane and triangular fibrocartilage complex in forearm stability.,"This study investigated the relative roles of the interosseous membrane (IOM) and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in the transmission of force from the hand to the humerus. Our findings suggest a spectrum of forearm destabilizing injuries. The intact radius abutting the capitellum provides the primary restraint to proximal migration of the radius. After radial head excision, up to 7 mm of proximal radial migration can occur under axial compression. If the TFCC or the IOM alone is disrupted, little alteration in load or displacement is evident. When both the midportion of the IOM and TFCC are incompetent, however, further proximal radial migration occurs, the radial stump abuts the humerus, and load is shifted back to the radial column. These data suggest that the central portion of the IOM is the crucial structural subdivision within the IOM acting as a restraint to proximal radial migration. The TFCC also resists proximal radial migration and participates in load transfer. We propose that clinical migration of the radius under an axial load greater than 7 mm implies disruption of both the midportion of the IOM and TFCC.",The Journal of hand surgery,8056963,1994
[Diagnosis of the ulnocarpal complex in MRI cineradiography].,"73 patients with persistent ulnar wrist pain of undetermined origin were examined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A series of 15 coronal slices was acquired using a T2* weighted gradient echo sequence. With repetitive measurement of those three slices that showed the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) best, the carpus was imaged 12 times during radial-ulnar deviation in increments of five degrees. The single images were combined according to their slice positions and continuously displayed on an image workstation, allowing for kinematic evaluation. Three different types of impingement of the TFCC were identified.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",8050738,1994
Ulnar variance: facts and fiction review article.,"The relative length of the ulna compared to the radius, or ulnar variance, appears to be an important element in wrist pathology. The length is determined by age, genetic factors, load (i.e. gymnasts) and gross elbow pathology. The negative ulnar variance or short ulna has been associated with Kienböck's disease, avascular necrosis of the scaphoid and scapholunate dissociations. This could not be confirmed in our observations. On the contrary, a long ulna (positive ulnar variance) is harmful for the ulnar compartment of the wrist as it causes degeneration and perforation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and cartilaginous wear of the carpal bones (ulnar impaction syndrome). The ulnar variance is also determinant for the morphology of the sigmoid notch of the radius. With wrist arthroscopy a more precise diagnosis of ulnar wrist pain has become possible.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,8171975,1994
Cartilaginous and ligamentous degeneration of the wrist. Anatomic study.,"The growing precision of diagnostic techniques (MRI, arthrography, arthroscopy) and the consequent increase of the diagnosis of cartilaginous and ligamentous lesions of the wrist led us to undertake a detailed anatomical study of the carpus and to extend this study to the search for correlations between these lesions and the radio-ulnar index. Fifty one cadaveric wrists were dissected from an elderly population (mean age of 76 years). Cartilaginous lesions were found in two-thirds of radioulnar joints of the wrist with a marked predominance for the lunate bone (43%). The triangular cartilage of the fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) was perforated in 23 wrists (46%). We established a correlation between the radio-ulnar index and perforations of the TFCC (p &lt; 0.05), as well as the thickness of this structure (p &lt; 0.05). The relationship between age and rupture of intrinsic ligaments (p &lt; 0.05), and the radio-ulnar index (p &lt; 0.05) and age was also established. We present our figures, discuss the clinical implications, and draw the following conclusions from this study. 1) The carpus is a complex joint which is subject to age-related degeneration. 2) The large number of cartilaginous lesions observed in this study must be taken into account in the interpretation of MRI and the &quot;over&quot; precise results of arthroscopy.",Annales de chirurgie de la main et du membre superieur : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main = Annals of hand and upper limb surgery,7531478,1994
Chronic triangular fibrocartilage complex tears. A case report and review of the literature.,"The treatment of a young man with chronic symptomatic gross subluxation of the distal radio-ulnar joint of the right wrist secondary to traumatic disruption of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is described. At operation, a strip of tensor fascia lata was used to stabilize the distal radio-ulnar joint. Complete relief of pain and restoration of normal function was obtained following surgery. The literature on TFCC disorders is also reviewed.",The West Indian medical journal,8160461,1993
Arthroscopic management of wrist triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries in the athlete.,"Wrist arthroscopy can facilitate early definitive diagnosis of debilitating soft tissue injuries in athletes. Many such injuries can be treated successfully with minimally invasive arthroscopic techniques, reducing the morbidity associated with surgical exposure and permitting earlier return to competition. The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is vulnerable to injury from rotational forces or axial load applied to the hand. Under arthroscopic control, injuries to the central articular disk can be treated by excision of unstable tissue fragments; peripheral separation of the disk from the dorsal or volar ligaments can be repaired with sutures to achieve complete healing. Avulsion fractures from the dorsal ulnar margin of the sigmoid notch of the radius are better treated through a small arthrotomy after initial arthroscopic evaluation.",Orthopedics,8234074,1993
Distal radioulnar joint function after Galeazzi fracture-dislocations treated by open reduction and internal plate fixation.,"Nineteen Galeazzi fracture-dislocations were reviewed clinically and roentgenographically at an average of 83 months after open reduction and internal fixation. Radiographic observation of fracture reduction was correlated with clinical results. Patients with anatomic fracture reduction had minimal sequelae and better or equal functional results than patients with imperfect reduction. Manual laborers had no weakness, but nonmanual laborers showed significant deficits in supination strength. Concomitant fractures of the wrist, the hand, or both were associated with significant pronation weakness. The volar approach was associated with a significant deficit of flexion/extension range of motion (ROM). Attention was focused on distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) function and pain. Distal radioulnar joint function was fully restored by open reduction and internal fixation of the radius and indirect anatomic reduction and functional aftercare of the DRUJ in 16 cases. Open revision, repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), and immobilization of the wrist are not necessary if anatomic reduction of the joint is obtained by indirect means such as open reduction and internal fixation of the radius.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,8339487,1993
[The painful ulno-carpal joint. Diagnosis and therapy].,"The ulnocarpal joint plays a critical role in hand and wrist function. It serves as part of forearm rotation as well as part of the carpal kinematics. The joint is comprised of the distal radio-ulnar articulation, triangular fibrocartilage complex, lunate, triquetrum, hamate, and pisiform, and the intra and extracapsular ligamentous and soft tissue constraints. Traumatic disruptions as well as chronic inflammatory conditions are commonplace. In addition to standard radiographs, arthrography, CT scanning, and MRI studies prove useful. Wrist arthroscopy is becoming of increasing importance in this region of the wrist. Ulnar impaction syndrome may occur associated with malunion of distal radius fracture, ulna positive variance, or chronic TFCC tears. Osteotomy of the distal radius or ulnar shortening osteotomy should be considered. Instability of the distal ulna can be treated with tenodesis procedures, hemi-resection arthroplasty, matched ulna resection or the Sauvé-Kapandji procedure.",Der Orthopade,8451048,1993
Arthroscopic suturing of TFCC lesions.,"Different types of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions have been described.

Gymnast wrist.,"Excessive or repetitive loading of an immature joint can lead to premature closure of the growth plate. In gymnastics this event is known as the gymnast wrist, or the Madelung-like deformity. Six new cases are presented. All had an ulnar-plus variance and an increased sagittal angle of the distal radial epiphysis. Five of them preferred to stop their sports career one was successfully treated with an arthroscopic debridement of the TFCC.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,8116370,1993
The gymnast's wrist: acquired positive ulnar variance following chronic epiphyseal injury.,"Five cases of symptomatic acquired positive ulnar variance are described. All cases occurred due to premature physeal closure of the growth plate in teenage girl gymnasts. All cases demonstrated ulnocarpal impingement, for which we describe a clinical test. Arthroscopic assessment of the wrist allowed us to assess the integrity of the TFCC (triangular fibrocartilaginous complex) and decide on the most appropriate surgery. Two patients needed distal ulna recession and one needed shaving for a TFCC perforation, with a good result.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1484254,1992
Lunate-triquetral and midcarpal joint instability.,"Instability of the ulnar side of carpus centers around the triquetrum, which is suspended by the ulnar triquetral ligaments and supported proximally by the TFCC. The triquetrum guides the lunate by an interosseous membrane and stout palmar ligaments that provide a relatively rigid connection between the two bones. Disruption of the LT ligament is frequently associated with pathology in the ulnar carpal area and may progress to triquetral instability, VISI, and finally, degenerative arthritic changes on the ulnar side of the carpus. The diagnosis of LT injuries is made by stress radiographs, arthrography, video-fluoroscopy, and arthroscopy. Treatment is initially nonoperative, but if symptoms persist, surgery is warranted. Arthroscopic debridement and pinning the LT joint, ligament repair or reconstruction, and intercarpal arthrodesis have all been reported as successful treatments. For the chronic problem confined to the LT joint, a limited intercarpal arthrodesis of the joint is the most predictable procedure for relieving pain without causing any significant restrictions in wrist motions. When there is a dissociation pattern in addition to LT instability, a more extensive intercarpal arthrodesis is required. Midcarpal instability occurs at the triquetral-hamate joint and is characterized by a dynamic subluxation of the joint. During ulnar deviation, the joint undergoes an exaggerated shift from volar flexion to dorsiflexion. Supportive care is generally successful; although in chronic cases, a midcarpal joint arthrodesis is often required.",Hand clinics,1460064,1992
The distal radioulnar joint.,"A phylogenic review shows the DRUJ to be a highly evolved and specialized structure. The diarthrodial joint, in combination with the TFCC, ligament complex, and oblique fibers of the distal interosseous membrane, permit rotation while preserving stability and transmitting the load borne by the radiocarpal joint to both bones of the forearm. Our improved, yet imperfect, understanding of the anatomy, biomechanics, and pathophysiology of the region, abetted by new imaging modalities and wrist arthroscopy, permit more precise diagnosis and thus more rational treatment. The persistent inconsistency of our results belies our imperfect comprehension. Thus humbled, consider Goethe's admonition as a call to further scrutiny and investigation, &quot;Theory and experience are opposed to each other in constant conflict. Only action can reconcile them.&quot;",Hand clinics,1460062,1992
Matched distal ulna resection for posttraumatic disorders of the distal radioulnar joint.,"In 1985 we published the results of the matched ulna resection in 44 patients, the majority of whom had rheumatoid arthritis. The matched ulna resection maintains the continuity of the distal ulna to the ulnar sling mechanism, including the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), and resects the distal ulna in a smooth, curved, convex fashion to match the contour of the radius throughout forearm rotation. This article presents the results of the procedure in patients with posttraumatic and mechanical disorders of the distal radioulnar joint. Good to excellent results were noted in 24 of 32 patients. The outcome was related to the severity of the patient's initial problem.",The Journal of hand surgery,1629556,1992
Traumatic disruption of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. Pathoanatomy.,"The surgical pathology in 42 cases of traumatic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) disruption comprised a spectrum of injury resulting in five basic stages of increasingly severe ulnar wrist instability. In all cases, detachment of the articular disk from its ulnar insertion was the principal cause of distal radioulnar joint instability; in 28 (67%), concomitant injury to the adjacent extensor carpi ulnaris sheath, the ulnocarpal ligaments, or the peritriquetral ligaments compounded the instability. Thus, rather than an isolated event, peripheral disruption of the disk often proved the major constituent of multicomponent lesions--lesions consistently suitable for repair. In this series of destabilizing TFCC disruption requiring operative treatment, awareness that some injuries selectively affect the articular disk, whereas others compromise wider zones of wrist anatomy, was essential to successful surgery.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,1735235,1992
Chronic wrist pain: spin-echo and short tau inversion recovery MR imaging and conventional and MR arthrography.,"The accuracy of T1-, proton-density-, and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequences and gadolinium-enhanced MR arthrography in evaluation of the triangular fibro-cartilage complex (TFCC) and the scapholunate (SL) and lunotriquetral (LT) ligaments was studied in 15 patients with chronic wrist pain. Arthrography and arthroscopy were used as standards of reference. Twelve patients also underwent imaging with short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences. MR imaging was more reliable in evaluation of the morphology of the TFCC and SL ligament than in that of the LT ligament. With arthrography as the standard, sensitivity was 0.721, specificity was 0.947, and accuracy was 0.887 for the TFCC; these values were 0.500, 0.864, and 0.765 for the SL ligament and 0.519, 0.455, and 0.490 for the LT ligament. No visualization of the SL ligament indicated a tear, but this sign was not helpful in evaluation of the LT ligament. Fluid in the distal radioulnar joint had a high association with TFCC tears. Accuracy with MR arthrography was higher than with the other sequences. STIR images were effective in evaluation of the TFCC. The combination of proton-density-and T2-weighted images appears to be useful because morphologic characteristics and the presence of fluid can be evaluated.",Radiology,1727283,1992
Anatomic and biomechanical analysis of the arthroscopic wafer procedure.,"The ulnar impaction syndrome is a common clinical entity that is most often associated with positive ulnar variance and is characterized by triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), lunate, and/or distal ulnar pathology. Traditional treatment for symptomatic ulnar impaction syndrome has been conservative; however, in cases refractory to nonoperative management, formal ulnar shortening has been successful in long-term clinical series. Recently, arthroscopic ulnar shortening, the &quot;arthroscopic wafer procedure&quot; (AWP) (debridement of the perforated TFCC margins and limited ulnar head resection using a motorized burr) has become an option to treat this clinical syndrome. In an attempt to evaluate the biomechanical efficacy of the AWP, an experimental study was undertaken using nine ulnar positive cadaver forearms. Each specimen was evaluated biomechanically using axial load cells and pressure-sensitive film to evaluate the effect of serial resection of the TFCC and distal ulna on axial load and ulnar carpal pressures. The results of this experimental study revealed a statistically significant unloading of the ulnar aspect of the wrist after excision of the centrum of the TFCC and resection of the radial two-thirds width of the ulnar head, to a depth of subchondral bone resection. Furthermore, additional bony resection tended to correlate favorably with the stage of TFCC pathology noted, i.e., the more advanced the stage, the more resection necessary to unload the ulnar aspect of the wrist. Based on this biomechanical study, a limited clinical series has been initiated with early favorable results. The AWP biomechanically unloads the ulnar carpal complex, and therefore has a theoretical potential of relieving the symptoms of the ulnar impaction syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,1637434,1992
"Evaluation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex tears by arthroscopy, arthrography, and magnetic resonance imaging.","Arthroscopic findings in 11 patients with chronic ulnar painful wrist were compared both with arthrographic and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging results to evaluate the accuracy of the former procedure in the detection of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions. MR imaging and arthrography investigations appeared to be sensitive modalities when compared with arthroscopic findings in TFCC lesions (specificity 100%; sensitivity 82 and 80%). MR imaging can be advantageously employed in the screening of patients suspected of having a TFCC tear, eliminating the necessity of an arthrographic examination. However, MR imaging could not define the exact site of the tear within the degenerate TFCC or detect lesions of the articular cartilage. Arthroscopy offers sure evidence of the site of TFCC lesion and more information about the intraarticular associated causes of chronic ulnar wrist pain such as chondromalacia and synovitis. An added benefit is that many of the pathologies seen can be treated using arthroscopic surgical techniques.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,1637432,1992

Six cases with associated anterior dislocation of the ulnar head].,"A particular course of markedly displaced wrist fracture associated with complete dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint and a real anterior dislocation of the ulnar head is related. In 5 other identical cases, treatment with external fixation achieved a more favourable result. These 6 cases concerning a particular type of wrist fracture, and a review of the literature, led us to suggest a potential pattern of TFCC lesions.

Arthroscopic treatment of TFCC lesions.,The TFCC bears axially applied load and stabilizes the distal radioulnar joint.

Wrist arthrography: value of the three-compartment injection method.,"Arthrography of the wrist was performed on 300 consecutive patients by injecting contrast material separately into the radiocarpal (RCJ), midcarpal (MCJ), and distal radioulnar (DRUJ) joints. The addition of MCJ and DRUJ injections to the standard RCJ injection significantly improved diagnostic yield. In 78 (26%) of the 300 cases, the abnormality was found after MCJ or DRUJ injections alone. Of the 103 triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) abnormalities identified, 27 (26%) could be demonstrated after DRUJ injection alone. Of the 145 abnormal RCJ and MCJ communications, 42 (29%) could be seen after MCJ injection alone. Similarly, 22 (15%) of the 145 abnormal RCJ and MCJ communications were seen after RCJ injection alone and would have been missed if only MCJ injection had been performed. Thus, three separate injections into the RCJ, MCJ, and DRUJ are necessary for complete arthrographic evaluation.",Radiology,2006283,1991
[Corrective osteotomy of malunited distal radius fractures].,"The malunion of the distal radius may result in shortening, radial impaction, volar angulation, dorsal displacement or rotatory deformity. For restoration, the anatomy and kinematics of the distal radioulnar joint and the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) are of importance. This nonunion consists of the articular disk, a meniscus homologue, the ulnar collateral ligament, and the dorsal and palmar radioulnar ligaments. Malunion of the distal radioulnar joint leads to an increase in loading on the individual parts, as well as pain and a decrease in supination and pronation. Osteotomy is indicated if the angulation of the malunion is more than 20 degrees in the frontal or sagittal plane. Corrective osteotomy requires detailed preoperative planning with calculation of the correct position in all planes. The most common operation that has proved to be effective is osteotomy of the radius, insertion of a trapezoidal bone graft in place, and internal fixation with a dorsal or volar plate.",Der Orthopade,2277707,1990
MR evaluation of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears in the wrist: comparison with arthrography and arthroscopy.,"To evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) in the detection of tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), 10 consecutive patients with posttraumatic chronic wrist pain were examined with MR, arthrography, and arthroscopy and the results were compared. The MR images of 16 control subjects were also examined to define the MR appearance of the normal TFCC. When compared with arthroscopic findings, both MR and arthrography had two false-negative results (sensitivity, 80%) and no false-positive results. Regarding the sites of the TFCC tears, the findings on MR did not always correlate with the findings on arthrography. In no case was MR able to visualize the cartilaginous lesions visible by arthroscopy. These preliminary results illustrate the ability of MR to assess the integrity of the TFCC and suggest its use as the first imaging technique following plain radiography in the evaluation of patients with chronic posttraumatic pain on the ulnar side of the wrist.",Journal of computer assisted tomography,2229576,1990
Triangular fibrocartilage disorders: injury patterns and treatment.,"On the basis of their arthroscopic experience with the diagnosis and management of acute and chronic lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), the authors review the anatomy and biomechanics of the TFCC, classify TFCC injury patterns, and suggest a treatment program for each pattern of injury. Traumatic patterns included central perforations (Class 1A), ulnar avulsions (Class 1B), distal avulsions (Class 1C), and radial avulsions (Class 1D). Degenerative (ulnar carpal abutment) patterns were classified (Class 2A-2E) by degree of severity and progressive involvement of adjacent structures. Arthroscopic debridement of the horizontal portion of the TFCC for Class 1A lesions and the Wafer procedure for Class 2C lesions have proved to be particularly successful over a 2-year follow-up, but the authors advise close long-term follow-up.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,2363780,1990
Arthroscopic debridement of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears.,"This prospective study, begun in 1984, involves 52 consecutive patients treated arthroscopically for triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears. Wrist arthrography showed the tear on the initial radiocarpal injection in 86%, and only on the post-stress films in 14%. Triple-phase bone scan was positive in only 66%. Diagnostic arthroscopy showed linear defects in 34%, a central perforation in 46%, and ulnar or peripheral perforations in 20%. However, 11 patients proved to have no visible TFCC tear (9% false-positive arthrography rate, or 9% false-negative rate for arthroscopy). Of the 41 patients followed for 13-42 months, 88% considered the procedure worthwhile, and 73% had complete relief of pain. The authors conclude that arthroscopic debridement of TFCC tears (often with removal of 2-3 mm of ulnar head) may be of benefit in reducing symptoms without increasing clinical ulnar instability. Wrist arthrography is useful in diagnosing perforations but not useful in evaluating the type, size, or significance of the tear.",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic &amp; related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,2363779,1990
Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition patterns in the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"To define the patterns of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), we examined the wrists of five adult, fresh-frozen cadavers using light and scanning electron microscopy and the wrist radiographs of 10 patients with a clinical diagnosis of CPPD disease. The radiographs consistently showed mineral deposits near or on the proximal and distal surfaces of the radial half of the TFCC. Light and electron microscopy showed that CPPD crystals formed distinct clusters sharply demarcated from uninvolved fibrocartilage. The density of crystal packing within clusters varied with the sharpness of demarcation of the clusters from the surrounding tissue. TFCC defects were consistently found in the vicinity of CPPD crystals, and degeneration of the articular cartilage on the ulnar half of the proximal surface of the lunate was associated with CPPD crystal deposition in the radial half of the TFCC. These observations suggest that degenerative tears of the TFCC and degeneration of the articular cartilage of the lunate are associated with CPPD crystal deposits in the TFCC.",Orthopedics,2153953,1990

Diagnosis and treatment of obscure ulnar-sided wrist pain.,"Thirty-seven patients were followed for symptoms of chronic ulnar-sided wrist pain in which specific physical examination and standard radiographs were unrevealing. Initial conservative treatment did not relieve the pain. The patients underwent further diagnostic studies including dynamic cineroentgenographic evaluation and radiocarpal arthrography. Nineteen of the 37 patients were demonstrated to have a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear on arthrography; 18 had a normal examination. The average follow up was 23 months. Seven of the 19 patients with TFCC tears have undergone operative treatment, and 5 (71%) remain symptomatic. Of the remaining 12 patients with TFCC tears treated nonoperatively, eight (67%) have persistent symptoms. Of the 18 patients whose arthrograms were normal, five eventually underwent surgical exploration, four of which remain symptomatic. Of the 13 patients without TFCC tears treated nonoperatively, seven (54%) continue to have symptoms. In our experience, both surgical exploration and nonoperative treatment have been less than satisfying. In addition, treatment results could not be correlated with arthrographic findings.",Orthopedics,2771827,1989
CT of the wrist for the evaluation of traumatic injuries.,"Computed tomography (CT) of the wrist can help evaluate many types of posttraumatic injuries, particularly bony trauma. Most wrist fractures can be diagnosed with routine radiography, but problematic cases and complicated healing fractures can be difficult to evaluate with conventional radiography. CT provides improved contrast resolution and multiplanar imaging. The results of complex healing fractures and fusion procedures can be facilitated with CT. Even in the face of advanced osteoporosis CT can delineate bone edges and detect small areas of bony fusion. The degree of bone graft assimilation can be determined with CT. Unlike conventional radiography, metal fixation pins and cast material do not obviate diagnostic exams with CT. Certain posttraumatic complications such as distal radioulnar joint incongruity and hypertrophy of Lister's tubercle can be detected with axial CT images. Complicated cases of retained foreign bodies can be evaluated with CT. The high-contrast resolution of CT allows precise localization of foreign bodies and can define anatomic relationships to adjacent vital structures such as joints, tendons, and carpal tunnel. Postarthrography CT of the wrist is an investigational tool that permits direct visualization of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Complete and partial tears of the TFCC can be evaluated with postarthrography CT. Ulnar capsular tears and disruptions of interosseous ligaments can also be evaluated with this technique. The exact role of postarthrography CT of the wrist, however, is uncertain at this point. Three-dimensional CT is receiving increasing interest and may eventually help the understanding of wrist pathomechanics and kinematics. In summary, CT of the wrist can be instrumental in evaluating complicated posttraumatic injuries of the wrist and has certain advantages over routine radiography.",Critical reviews in diagnostic imaging,2688677,1989
Arthrographic surface anatomy of the carpal triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"In a review of 364 radiocarpal and 123 distal radioulnar joint arthrograms we identified 44 (12%) patients with contrast defects at either the proximal or distal surface of the carpal triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Differences in their arthrographic characteristics distinguished two separate groups of patients; one with similar and another with dissimilar appearing TFCC surface contrast collections. Thirty-one of our 44 patients had similar appearing, isolated radial-sided collections at either the proximal or distal TFCC surfaces. Our arthrographic, demographic, and historical study of these patients suggests that the collections are not caused by traumatic partial TFCC tears but represent a normal anatomic variant, probably a synovial recess at the radial TFCC attachment. Arthrography and dissection of a limited number of cadaveric specimens confirmed this conclusion. The second group included the remaining 13 patients. This group had contrast collections at either the proximal or distal TFCC surface, which varied in location and appearance. This smaller group is more likely to represent those uncommon patients with partial TFCC defects caused by tears.",The Journal of hand surgery,3225407,1988
Partial excision of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"A cadaver model was used to evaluate the effect of partial excision of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) on ulnar wrist kinetics. Excision of less than two thirds of the horizontal portion of the TFCC was found to have no statistical effect experimentally on forearm axial load transmission. This data supports, from a biomechanical standpoint, partial excision of the central portion of the TFCC--a procedure advocated clinically by some for treatment of a central TFCC perforation.",The Journal of hand surgery,3379276,1988
Distal radioulnar joint dysfunction.,"Dislocations of the DRUJ, when diagnosed promptly, may be successfully treated by closed reduction and immobilization.

Arthrographic evaluation of the carpal triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"One hundred sixty-two patients had analyses for correlation of triangular fibrocartilage abnormalities (TFCC), with duration and location of pain and other possible associated radiographic, scintigraphic, and arthrographic abnormalities. Results indicated that TFCC perforations did not correlate with any pain complex or other associated radiographic, arthrographic, or scintigraphic abnormality. No association with carpal instability or with ulnar variance could be identified. No definition between perforations that were posttraumatic and those that were the results of a degenerative process could be made. Several small defects on both the proximal and distal surfaces of the TFCC were identified. They do not appear to have been reported previously in the literature.

Irreducible dislocation of distal radial ulnar joint.,"Volar dislocations of the distal radioulnar joint are often missed initially. Late closed reduction of this joint is generally unsuccessful. Even acute reductions of the distal radioulnar joint is often incomplete or unsuccessful. This is not the case for dorsal dislocations. Obstruction to reduction may be due to the contracted volar soft tissues in late cases or to the dynamic pull of the pronator quadratus acutely. A previously unrecognized cause for difficulty in reduction is the torn triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC). When the tear occurs at its dorsal insertion on the radius, leaving the TFCC attached to the volar radius and to the ulna, it may block the reduction of the ulnar head into the sigmoid notch. Open reduction is required in such cases with repair of the TFCC.",Orthopaedic review,3453929,1986
Relationship between ulnar variance and triangular fibrocartilage complex thickness.,The thickness of the thinnest aspect of the articular disc portion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was experimentally measured and compared with ulnar variance. There is an inverse relationship between positive ulnar variance and TFCC thickness.,The Journal of hand surgery,6491211,1984
Arthrotomography of the wrist. The triangular fibrocartilage complex.,"Eighteen fresh cadaver wrists were radiographically studied using both arthrography and arthrotomography, to evaluate the results of the two techniques. With arthrography, communications between the distal radioulnar and radiocarpal joints were discovered in eight of the 18 wrists (44%). Although defects in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) could be inferred from the arthrograms, the locations and dimensions of the defects could not be assessed satisfactorily. Using arthrotomography, three distinct patterns of TFCC defects were observed radiographically, which correlated with subsequent anatomic dissections of the cadaver specimens. Type I defects, located near the radial margin of the TFCC, are long, narrow posteroanterior fissures with thick regular borders that readily appose. Type II defects, located more centrally in the TFCC, are wide defects with thin irregular margins. Type III defects represent a communication between the prestyloid recess and the distal radioulnar joint. Arthrotomography of the wrist accurately delineates TFCC defects in cadaveric specimens and may become a valuable clinical radiographic procedure.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,6821992,1983
The triangular fibrocartilage complex of the wrist--anatomy and function.,"The anatomy and function of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) of the wrist was studied through anatomic dissections and biomechanical testing of 61 specimens. The TFCC was found to be a homogenous structure composed of, but not dissectable into, the articular disc, the dorsal and volar radioulnar ligaments, the meniscus homologue, the ulnar collateral ligament, and the sheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris. The TFCC was found to be perforated in 53% of specimens dissected, and all of the wrists with a demonstrable perforation showed evidence of damage or erosion of the cartilage of the lunate and/or distal ulna. Biomechanical studies suggest that the TFCC functions both as a cushion for the ulnar carpus and as a major stabilizer of the distal radioulnar joint. Perforations of the TFCC can result in the ulna-lunate abutment and cartilage erosion. Since excision of the TFCC may lead to ulnolunate abutment, chronic wrist pain, and/or instability of the distal radioulnar joint, it is not recommended.",The Journal of hand surgery,7229292,1981
